Only Hugin can calm things down when the two set their tongues at one another. While Gweyn cannot compete with the sheer colour of Merla’s vocabulary she holds her own through the careful use of biting sarcasm. Observers have compared it to man with a maul fighting another with a longknife.</p>\n<h2>Hugin of Brandas</h2>\n<p>Hugin, a very able journeyman, would be master of his own inn if he wasn’t so well paid by Jamys. Customers passing through will assume it is this jolly and approachable man who is the landlord; assuming Jamys is a well-to-do guildsman.</p>\n<p>The temperaments and skills of Hugin and Merla perfectly complement one another. Merla realises this but Hugin is blind to the possibility of a shared future. She plans to propose a business deal to Hugin he won’t be able to turn down when she has saved enough but prefers not to think about Jamys’ reaction. Hugin, meanwhile, admires Gweyn and her skill in brewing. She is blind to his interest and hides her attraction to Merla behind a brisk manner and harsh words.</p>\n<h2>Justi and Donara</h2>\n<p>These two sisters are orphans of an old business acquaintance Jamys had killed when he began to speak too freely of their dealings. It seemed only right to offer them a roof over their heads and the chance to earn a living as barmaids.</p>\n<p>Jamys is very fond of both of them and regularly accepts offers of their favours. Currently Justi shares his bed, but last month it was Donara. He keeps both girls well clothed as befits a respectable establishment with pretensions to class.</p>\n<h2>Daftar</h2>\n<p>The second pot-boy has very light fingers. He picks the pockets of any customers Jamys tells him to and can usually replace an item before a guest realises it has gone missing. Jamys has the same feeling for Daftar that Merla has for Absel. They both recognise the potential the boys have in their chosen field of expertise. Daftar is now beginning to learn the art of cat burglary.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/scenes/Heart_of_Darkness/White_Stoat_Inn_GM_Map.PNG","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.vcFoOoPKmyOyauRL","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_b8slu2n3iw","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/The White Stoat Inn","color":"#212121","sort":600000}}}

Even the air is hot, and still; as if it's locked between the endless walls of greenery on either bank. It sucks the sweat from the skin; though the Kuboran guides are doing all the work, propelling the craft against the Denia’s sluggish current. Ten leagues up river, it feels like every furnace breathe is a labour.  Kutz remembered what the guide said when he gestured to the south bank: 'Never get off the boat'. Perhaps this was the same as all the other trips into the forest but it was certainly not going to be a comfortable one. Damned insects. His old friend turned to face him, rivulets of sweat coursing down his face, and whispered, 'I've got a bad feeling about this ...'.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adventure Outline</h2>\n<p>Heart of Darkness takes place in the Summer of 720TR and sees a group of player characters (PCs) travel up the River Denia into the Peran wilderness on a mission which may come from the Earl of Tormau. As they travel complications are added and a growing sense of foreboding envelopes them. Finally they are confronted by a source of ancient evil.</p>\n<p>Peran is known as the great wilderness of Harn. Dense first growth forest, much of it still in its primeval glory, cloaks the hills and valleys that run from the Rayesha Mountains to the coast. Home to the fierce Kubora the forest is not only mysterious but very dangerous. The tribes are known to have a capricious nature that can turn from welcome to threat in an eye-blink.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Essential Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The White Stoat Inn; (<a title=\"The White Stoat Inn\" href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/places/white-stoat-inn/\">https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/places/white-stoat-inn/</a>)</li>\n<li>Asawne Kubora; (<a title=\"Awsawne Kubora\" href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/people-cultures/asawne_kubora/\">https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/people-cultures/asawne_kubora/</a>)</li>\n<li>Denal Kubora; (<a title=\"Denal Kubora\" href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/people-cultures/denal-kubora/\">https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/people-cultures/denal-kubora/</a>)</li>\n<li>A version of the HarnMaster Rules; (<a title=\"Hârnmaster 3\" href=\"https://secure.columbiagames.com/product/4001-PDF\">https://secure.columbiagames.com/product/4001-PDF</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Helpful Resources:  available from <a style=\"font-size:14px\" title=\"CGI\" href=\"https://secure.columbiagames.com/products/Harn\">Columbia Games</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HârnMaster: Barbarians;</li>\n<li>Tribes of the Kubora;</li>\n<li>Peran;</li>\n<li>Bedenes;</li>\n<li>Warriors of Mameka;</li>\n<li>Mamaka, Master of Steel;</li>\n<li>Kingdom of Rethem;</li>\n<li>Tormau;</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>HârnMaster</h2>\n<p>Although this scenario is designed for the <a title=\"The HârnMaster System for Foundry VTT\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3\">HârnMaster system</a>, and several examples of skill rolls have been included, it would be relatively easy to convert the scenario to another rules system.

{"_id":"38PLfIvyokkI7uXb","name":"ORIGINS & HISTORY","content":"<p>When Kemlar’s son Crador was blinded he was cursed to wander alone outside human company. However Kemlar granted him the power to come to the Kubora in their sleep; if they failed to live lives as Kemlar decreed Crador would make their nightmares real.</p>\n<p>So it was that Crador became the shadow lurking on the edge of every camp fire: thanked for all things good; blamed for the bad; and venerated in the hope of future favour. Rendered mad by the pain of his torments Crador became fickle and demanded more and more from the tribes lest he curse them with their worst nightmares.</p>\n<p>One tribe, the Denal, refused to bow to Crador or court his whim. They determined to find and confine ‘The Trickster’ once and for all. The hunt they began lasted generations and their pursuit harried Crador away from the ranges of the tribes and into lands no Kuboran coveted: the Denia Marshes. The other tribes, fearing ‘The Dream Maker’, left the Denal to their quest but appreciated the absence of poor luck, illness and disaster during this time. For generations Crador spared the other tribes and focused all his attention on those that pursued him: the Denal.</p>\n<p>Though the Denal could confine Crador within the Broken Lands to the east of the Denia Marshes they could not contain the dreams that he sent. They were tormented into sleeplessness during the night and cursed with bad luck during the day. Slowly these once valiant people had their spirit broken until they wished nothing more but to live in their god’s forsaken marsh and serve him. All they wished was that the nightmare should end. With the Denal cowed Crador returned to tormenting all Kubora until the sacrifices began again. However, food or animal sacrifices were not always enough. Kemlar had denied the Kubora the right to take a human life in worship so they took to choosing a youth or maiden to be sent ‘as a gift’ to Crador. To this day, when sorely pressed, the Kubora will send a ‘gift of sacrifice’ to the Denal who convey the boy or girl to the Broken Lands where Crador decides their future. That has become the sad fate of the Denal: intermediaries between man and god; warped servants of a warped god. Over the centuries the Denal have changed physically as well as morally. It is as if the transformation from brave champions to craven servants has been reflected in their often twisted bodies.</p>\n<p>Denal girl children display a panoply of minor birth defects: disfiguring birth marks or extra digits are common. Other differences, not always so noticeable at birth become very marked with aging, such as facial hair, crook backs, and joint defects.

With age his games became more malicious and sinister. He stole and drank and whored his way from tribe to tribe but still Kemlar did not discipline him.</p>\n<p>Finally young Crador went too far and ravished a chieftain’s daughter. A council of all the tribes demanded Kemlar take the boy in hand and so their Guide called Crador before him.</p>\n<p>When his accusers voiced their charges the youth laughed in their faces. Kemlar tried to keep order but the warriors would not hear him and seized the youth. Some, fearing to take the life of their Guide‘s only son, cried ‘Let him no longer see temptation.

Unfortunately those treaties currently seem a little bit fragile. Over the last season traders have been reporting more losses to the Kubora than has been usual for a year or two.</p>\n<p>The Earl’s family have always had a good relationship with the Kubora.

When Arlun the Barbarian came out of the forest and made Rethem what it is today, the Lynnaeus called upon those ancient bonds of friendship to keep Tormau.

If so it is important to note that the Spirit of Earth, and any corrupted creatures will instinctively shy away from a living Kutz. Alternatively the PCs can leave the Hand and recover in the tunnel that brought them to the Place of the Hand.</p>\n<p>As night falls they will see the Hand cloaked in the palest flicker of red luminescence; making the Hand seem to writhe as if trying to free itself from the ground. Alas that freedom will not come this day...</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Reaction of the Denal</h2>\n<p>The Denal have posted scouts near ‘The Leave Taking’:</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs arrive there with Kutz, or are willing to show the Denal evidence of his death...</strong></p>\n<p>The Denal will assume that the ‘Outsiders’ have defeated their champion and stopped him in his mission. They will do all they can to earn the PC’s favour. They will be cared for and over the next days and weeks they, and Kutz, will heal. Finally the Denal will take the PCs and Kutz back to the cataract and send them back down river.</p>\n<p>News will slowly filter across Peran that ‘Crador will not rest’ and a degree of stability will return to the frontier. Den Hapra will refuse to accompany his old master down river if he survived, he is hopelessly addicted to the narcotics the Denal have fed him and cannot conceive of travelling way from their source.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs arrive without Kutz or are unwilling to share evidence of his death...</strong></p>\n<p>The Denal will assume that the ‘Outsiders’ have failed in their effort to defeat their champion and that he continues in his quest to bring Crador some rest. The PCs will be treated as defeated foes: stripped of everything of value they possess and then dumped at the head of the cataract to make their way on foot back to civilisation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the Denal will wait for a sign that the Kutz has succeeded in his task and the frontier will remain tense.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Reaction of the Asawne</h2>\n<p><strong>If the PCs return to Gomas Straight Arrow...</strong></p>\n<p>He will listen silently to their tale and then wish them well saying that ‘the gods make their own paths which we must follow’. Their efforts have earned his respect and he will offer them the opportunity to recover before sending them back to Quyn. This is when ‘The Watcher’ scene can be played if it was not used on the upstream journey and the GM wants a hook to take the PCs to Bedenes.</p>\n<p><strong>If they brought Kutz out or have proof that they killed him...</strong></p>\n<p>Gomas is relieved that the rumours that Crador will rest will now cease and offers the PCs his friendship, something he does not give lightly to southrons. Whenever they find themselves in need of his help he will seek to provide it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Fate of Kutz</h2>\n<p>If Kutz survives (and it will be better for subsequent adventures if he does) he remains as empty eyed as he was within the chamber. His mind appears to have been entirely consumed by the Heart of Darkness. Occasionally he seems animated during dreams but the rest of the time he stands or sits where he is left. If food is put in his hand and it is pushed to his mouth he mechanically stuffs it into his mouth, chewing and swallowing without expression.</p>\n<p>Delivering Kutz to Jamys at the White Stoat will lead to the reward the PC were promised, though Jamys is clearly unnerved by the condition of Coln of Kutz. Jamys will discretely deliver the mercenary to the Caer and be glad to be rid of him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The Effect of any ‘Vision’ of the Heart</h2>\n<p>Any PC that touched the Heart will wake nightly for a week and then weekly for a month from a disjointed nightmare. The nightmare will repeat more irregularly after that. Over time certain aspects of the dream begin to stick in the PC’s mind:</p>\n<p>The PC is looking outwards into a maelstrom of circling ragged and tattered spirits, each with the appearance of a gaping maw full of angry teeth. Beyond the whirlwind of spirits is a fiery wilderness in which the land, the sky and the very air seems to burn with an intense heat that threatens to melt the character’s eyeballs.</p>\n<p>One of the foul creatures of the maelstrom has locked its teeth onto whichever limb was in contact with the Heart and seems to be sucking out their very essence.</p>\n<p>As they wake sweating, and possibly screaming, they have a single abiding emotional sensation: spiteful hate.</p>\n<p>So ends the PCs journey into <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Peran: Heart of Darkness</strong></span> … Will they brave <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Golotha: The Deeper Dark</strong></span>?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>PC Benefits and Potential Plot Hooks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PCs should open Old Jarinese &amp;/or Folklore (Kubora) as a bonus to any other skill development.</li>\n<li>A sufficiently talented PCs could spend some time recording their memory of the journey onto a Poetic Map of the River Denia and the marshes beyond. The GM should secretly roll the <em><strong>Drawing</strong></em> skill check and note the level of success which can be used as a reflection of the map’s accuracy and the effect on the journey of a buyer who uses it to avoid getting lost:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: only 30% chance of getting lost while following it;</p>\n<p><strong>MS</strong>: 60% chance of getting lost;</p>\n<p><strong>MF</strong>: 90% chance of getting lost;</p>\n<p><strong>CF</strong>: certain to get lost and have difficulty finding their way back to civilisation until they tear the damn thing up!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The PCs will be offered a period employment by Jamys (at the urging of the Earl) so that he can keep an eye on them. The Caer is not keen to have what has happened to Kutz circulating freely.</li>\n<li>The White Stoat is an excellent base for further adventures in North West Rethem which could involve the political tensions between the Earl and the Crown; work raiding the Earl of Ithiko; or further missions into the Peran wilderness, including a journey to the Kuboran Moot at Kustan. Alternatively Jamys may want to use them as deniable Lia-Kavair muscle in his ‘relations’ with neighbouring guildmasters.</li>\n<li>The PCs may hear rumours that information about Peran and the Kubora can be sold to a scribe based somewhere in Emesa Hundred.</li>\n<li>They may help Gedis find his parents if they work out that the boy was confined in Bedenes. While the Earl will not move openly against the Warriors of Mameka on his nortern flank he might not be too upset to see them distracted.</li>\n<li>The Earl might also pay for accurate information from Emesa and bedenes, while Jamys might want couriers for the agents he has recently sent north.</li>\n<li>The reputation the PCs will nopw have among the Asawne and Denal Kubora may mean other tribes come to them for help, or as allies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>DESIGNER NOTES</h2>\n<p>The name ‘Coln of Kutz’ often keys players into the Coppola and then the original Conrad. <em>Apocalypse Now</em> can help with the sense of isolation of ‘civilised’ characters in a wilderness environment.

She is also honoured by being able to invoke Heneryne in times of need, particularly in her role as the village’s mid-wife.</p>\n<p>‘Heneryne’s Crone’ is usually the oldest unmarried woman or widow in any clan and that is certainly true of Relatarn who chose never to marry. Every Crone may choose a young woman as her apprentice so that were she to die suddenly her lore would be preserved. 17 year old Fasiria has fulfilled this role for 2 years but is considering whether she should accept an offer of marriage made this winter by one of the younger warriors. Relatarn considers her enormously talented and is seeking to influence her decision having seen two previous apprentices ‘waste themselves’ on a man.</p>\n<p>By tradition the two must live apart from the village lest they are sullied by too much contact with men. However it was Relatan who saw the signs of declining harvests five years ago that others had yet to notice and convinced Gomas they should move the village to its new site.</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.sb4qLsyzhtuMEAuy","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0b2m4o5az66m","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Asawne Kubora","color":"#1723c4","sort":1000000}}}

The tribe has suffered regular raids by the Warriors for a generation but took revenge in 718, harrying the Agrikans as they retreated from their failure to take Kustan.</p>\n<h2>ORIGINS &amp; HISTORY</h2>\n<p>Tribal myth says the tribes that became the Asawne first settled on the banks of the Denia in the time of Nebran, when the Corani legions were finally pushed back across the river in 480. The Asawne, like the Uld, made their peace with the surviving Corani around Emesa establishing a mutually beneficial trading relationship.</p>\n<p>More than a century later Hugai Lynnaeus, a minor Corani landowner fleeing the persecution of the Theocracy of Tekhos, approached the Asawne Kubora through Emesan intermediaries. The Kubora had no sympathy for the Morgathian regime and supported Hugai as he slowly eroded its support around Tormau. Together with a band of renegade outlaws, Asawne and Suyari warriors and Emesans who had not forgotten the skills of the legion, Hugai took Tormau in 588. He swore friendship to the Kuboran tribes that had aided him, a pact that saved his successor Henail when Arlun swept south in 629. Convinced by the Asawne that he could trust the holder of Caer Tormau, Arlun sealed his pact with clan Lynnaeus by marrying Henail’s daughter.</p>\n<p>The Asawne stayed on good terms with the Lynnaeus when Arlun died even though they returned to the forest disenchanted with the ‘civilised’ life he had offered them. Though Rethem descended into blood and war the tribe continued to trade with Tormau and has offered logging rights in return for metal wares and weapons.</p>\n<p>Today the young men of the Asawne Kubora make up more than a quarter of the Kuboran mercenaries maintained by Denyl, Earl of Tormau, and may well fight beside a Lynnaeus against despotism once more.</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/scenes/Heart_of_Darkness/Denia_River_Valley_Kubora.PNG","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.3cfg78U6nXSNv6J8","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0b2m4o5az66m","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Asawne Kubora","color":"#1723c4","sort":250000}}}

The Kubora have a saying about the Yelgri: <em>they will eat anything that moves and if something doesn’t move they will hit it until it does</em>. However, it might be possible for PCs to use the antagonism between the flights of Yelgri to set the harpies at one another’s throat.

This means the climb is never very steep. In cross-section, however, erosion has carved the cataract into a steep sided bowl rising from the edge of the river to the forest above. This means that the group will have to walk in single file within a few feet of the river.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.gu17e71t82z08bQ0]{Lower Cataract}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.W1c6Mj9XWMvlLUWF]{Upper Cataract}</p>\n<p>Though the <em>curach</em> are very light and ideal for the sort of portage now required they cannot be carried as quickly through the forest above. Acurdin will also make it clear that the path they are following is the traditional, and agreed, route to the top of the cataract and the marshes beyond. There are great risks from the Denal if they travel by any other route.</p>\n<p>With the gear stowed in the boats two men can carry them but four can carry them more quickly. The Kubora are used to this and are also used to moving on the limestone in their soft leather shoes. The stretches of deep, fast flowing, water between the steps of the cataract present a risk to those less used to the slick limestone.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about abandoning the boats...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin tells them that he and the guides will return to the village on foot, leaving the boats with the PCs. They may need them to continue their journey into the marshes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>The journey beside the cataract</strong></h3>\n<p>The journey to the head of the cataract takes 4 hours (one watch) if only the Kubora carry the boats (and requires <strong>2 <em>STUMBLE</em></strong> rolls per PC to stay on their feet during the journey).</p>\n<p>If the PCs help then the journey-time is halved (to 2 hours) but the risk of a fall increases (<strong>Four <em>STUMBLE</em></strong> rolls per PC). If the PCs become worried after a couple of tumbles they can continue to help the Kubora but slow the pace a great deal. This removes the need for any subsequent <em><strong>STUMBLE</strong></em> rolls but stretches the journey to two full watches. It’s actually quicker to allow the Kubora to do the work than to ‘help’ them while taking inordinate care to avoid a tumble!</p>\n<p><strong>Consequences of a failed STUMBLE roll:</strong></p>\n<p>Any PC who stumbles will slip into the water and must succeed with a second <em><strong>STUMBLE</strong></em> roll to stay in the shallows.</p>\n<p>Failing the second roll means they must make use of <em><strong>Swimming</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Failing the swimming roll means they are swept down the cataract and requires a subsequent<em><strong> Swimming CS</strong></em> to regain the upper hand over the river. Repeated failure risks drowning (see HârnMaster Rules for swimming/drowning).  Efforts by those on the bank to throw ropes, hold out spears to help, etc. can be judged with appropriate use of the rescuers’ skills.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>When they reach the top of the cataract the PCs and their guides are confronted by two 6 foot stakes driven into the river bank on either side of the trail. Each is topped by a human skull.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.qoPzsKiwMf31aA7i]{Top of the Cataract}</p>\n<p><strong>If the guides are asked about the skulls...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin and the other guides say nothing but bow grimly to the skulls as a mark of respect. They do not say if the respect is to the skulls or to the Denal, who placed them there.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color:#e03e2d\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>GM Note</strong></span>:  Depending on how you would like the next scene to play-out, the option exists for Acurdin and his Asawne guides to part ways with the PCs at this point.  Indeed, the players may insist, or try to convince Acurdin to turn back, rather than risk their own lives.  In order to trigger this decision point, you may have the Asawne engage in a hushed \"debate\" as they fully understand that proceeding past the gateway of skulls means almost certain conflict with their Denal cousins.</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Beyond this grisly gateway the path moves away from the river bank through the edge of the forest.

By tradition any Kuboran making the journey should leave something of value along the path. Awareness or Survival will reveal that some of the items are very old indeed, though of little intrinsic value. The only Kubora not required to leave something are the ‘gifts of sacrifice’ being escorted to their doom.</p>\n<p>Acurdin and each of the guides leave something along the way. The PCs are not required to do so, they are not Kubora and not bound by the tradition. That doesn’t mean they can’t leave something in the hope of attracting some good luck.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about the ‘gift of sacrifice’...</strong></p>\n<p>Kemlar forbade blood sacrifice but in dire need a tribe might send someone to the ‘Hand of Crador’ from where none return. During Acurdin’s lifetime the Asawne have sent only two such ‘gifts’. A ‘gift’ is intended to serve Crador for eternity, and it is the Denal who carry the gift to the god.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.c7xb4Ih1qQYiOCPO]{Act III - Scene 3: Murder in the Dark}</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/actors/NPCs/Heart%20of%20Darkness/Ardo%20of%20Guil%20v2.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.U2XB45v3vLwWtJsc","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_3t0858bnqro","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act III:  Further Upstream","color":"#4f86b0","sort":300000}}}

The clans are spread evenly through the tribe’s range but only the clan of Hanuhn Gomas ‘Straight Arrow’ maintains a fixed village throughout the year. The clans of Derel ‘the Tall’; Arain ‘Half Deer’ and Roncan, called ‘Tree Strong’ are more seasonally nomadic, settling only during the Autumn, Winter and early Spring.</p>\n<p>Arain is the Asawne Druhn and can field a warband of some 80 warriors in their prime, along with nearly 20 youths to support them. However conflict is more often on a smaller scale, between hunting bands setting and clearing trap lines or in pursuit of deer and wild cattle.

{"_id":"QB0RXECZqHV47vS4","name":"Act I - Scene 2:  Making Inquiries","content":"<h2>Scene 2:  Making Enquires</h2>\n<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>\n<p>The PCs have a few hours the following morning to make enquires before Jamys expects them to depart for Quyn. (<em>Tormau</em> includes a map of the entire settlement and details of the political background but if that article is unavailable it is enough to know that the small town stradles the only trail arriving at the castle from the south. To the north of the promontory on which the castle sits, overlooking the sandy Otrend Cove, is the camp of the Earl’s substantial mercenary army).</p>\n<h3><strong>GM Aims</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To allow the PCs the chance to ask some questions around Tormau before departing.</li>\n<li>To keep up the pace by making the PCs very aware they have relatively little time before leaving and that if they delay then not only may Jamys get angry, but more importantly they may miss their guides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>PC Outcomes</strong></h3>\n<p>They confirm some of that they have been told but also get a hint that not all is well with the Kubora.</p>\n<h3><strong>Description of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>There will be enough time for each PC to visit a single possible source of information from those listed below. If they work in pairs or a single group then the number of potential sources they can talk to will be reduced in proportion.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>The Earl's Mercenaries</strong></h3>\n<p>About 200 mercenaries, mostly Ivinians and Kuborans, are housed in tents on the Common at the North end of Tormau. While there are some raids into the south they have little to do but prepare to defend Tormau from the King when that weak willed son of a crone builds up the courage to come north.</p>\n<p>The Ivinians are housed in tents provided by the Earl, while the Kubora prefer hide tents of their own making. A few lines of tents are occupied by Rethemi and other Harnic mercenaries. These Rethemi are the Earl’s only mercenary cavalry and their horse lines and paddock sit between the Kubora and the Ivinians.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Hrafna - an Ivinian</strong></h3>\n<p>He speaks poor Harnic so conversation is stilted and cannot extend beyond simple language; but in return for a drink he is happy to talk.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Coln Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>Kutz? Big man – rough bastard (both of these are compliments from an Ivinian). He was one of the ‘Runners’ - haven’t seen him for maybe a season - maybe longer.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about ‘Runners’ …</strong></p>\n<p>The Earl often seeks out what he calls ‘Forest Runners’.  They go on missions into the forest; the castle trusts them more than most of the natives (gesturing to the Kuboran camp). What they do he doesn’t know, but they’re gone for days and weeks sometimes.</p>\n<p>He can provide no other information.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Suricar – a Kuboran</strong></h3>\n<p>While the experience of most ‘civilised’ men is that Kubora from the deep woods are surly and aggressive Suricar has been in the pay of the Earl for 3 years and has mellowed in his approach to non-Kubora. No doubt he’d still happily cut their throats if he encountered them in the forest but he’s got used to pay and the Earl’s supplies and does not intend to have to run for the forest by behaving stupidly. His primary language is the Old Jarinese dialect spoken by the Kubora but he’s picked up a lot of Harnic during his time in the Earl’s service.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Coln Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>Kutz went out of his way to get to know the Kuboran mercenaries and to learn their language – not like most of the southrons or northmen. He was a favoured coedrheg to the tribes and Suricar accompanied him on a couple of trips to the Asawne and Uld Kubora.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about ‘coedrheg’ ...</strong></p>\n<p>That is the word the Kubora gave to the non-Kubora who picked up some of their ways. They sometimes acted as go betweens or emissaries to the tribes. Coed means ‘trees’ and rheg means ‘run’ in their dialect. They are respectful of Kuboran ways and go out of their way to show they understand they are the inferiors when in the forest. Kutz knew he was an outsider and behaved honourably. In the end he began to realise he didn’t need all the iron many of the mercenaries wear and dressed for the forest.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked what might have happened to Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe he didn’t learn enough - the forest feeds on those who fear it. Rumour is he took a wrong turn and ended up in the marshes where the Ogres will have eaten him. or perhaps...</p>\n<p>At this point Suricar very pointedly shuts up as if realising he’s about to say more than he should and takes a carved token strung around his neck firmly in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs manage to get a look at the token, or somehow convince Suricar to show it to them...</strong></p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.B2s6cQtRVZUGh1iX]{Wooden Token}</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about the token …</strong></p>\n<p>He has nothing more to say and further probing will result in him looking to his friends. They show themselves ready for a fight if the PCs don’t take the hint and end their questioning.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Biris of Thaldan - a Rethemi Light Horseman</strong></h3>\n<p>Biris is paid by the Earl to act as guards for favoured traders going north or south from Tormau.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Coln Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>He has never heard of Kutz though he knows the Earl regularly sends messengers into the forest. He will suggest the PCs talk to Tursar of Megelese, a trader in town makes his money trading with that half-breed Scarlet Dak. He might know something …</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Scarlet Dak...</strong></p>\n<p>If asked about Scarlet Dak he can tell them that Dak is a half-breed trader from Golotha who makes a fortune trading with the Kubora.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Tursar of Meglese – trader/usurer</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><em>Intrigue</em></strong>: Tursar has trade agreements with Daquer of Iyesin, a Golothan mercantyler who deals with the Kubora. That brings him into conflict with the Agrikan fighting order at Bedenes.</p>\n<p>Tursar gives ‘nowt for nowt’ but for a generous bribe in cash he will share what he knows of the Kubora and their relationship with the Earl. His ‘fee’ will be 25-50% of the PC’s down payment (exactly how much is left to the GM and may be influenced by PC Rhetoric).</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Coln Kutz...</strong></p>\n<p>He was probably one of those sent to make the treaties with the tribes and to ensure they were kept. Unfortunately those treaties currently seem a little bit fragile. Over the last season traders have been reporting more losses to the Kubora than has been usual for a year or two.</p>\n<p>The Earl’s family have always had a good relationship with the Kubora. The current Earl had reached an accommodation with the tribes that means those wearing his colours are usually left alone. That’s no longer the guarantee of safety it was and the tribes are more restless than they’ve been for years.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Clan Lynnaeous and the Tribes...</strong></p>\n<p>Clan Lynnaeus lived in the forests north of Tormau during the dark times of the Theocracy and made friends among the Kubora. Then, when the time was right, they raised a rebellion to take Tormau for their own. When Arlun the Barbarian came out of the forest and made Rethem what it is today, the Lynnaeus called upon those ancient bonds of friendship to keep Tormau. Even when Arlun was gone and the Kubora went back to the forest the Earls of Tormau have tried to keep them as allies. Now, with things the way they are with the King the Earl needs friends and the Kubora serve cheap and fight hard.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about recent events …</strong></p>\n<p>He doesn’t know if it means anything but the last time a Kuboran raider’s body was brought in it was wearing a small disc of wood with one side crudely carved to show what Tursar took to be a full sun, and the other side a thin sickle moon.</p>\n<p>When one of the Earl’s Kubora saw it he went paler than Tursar had ever seen a Kuboran go. He doesn’t know what the symbols meant but it frightened the Kuboran, and Kubora don’t frighten easily. He’s not prepared to part with the token – he thinks it might be some sort of charm against the Kubora. Rumours he’s picked up say that the symbols may tell of trouble coming. That’s why some locals say Setarn has gone to make his peace with his barbarian gods after all these years of civilisation. Tursar thinks the wily old Kuboran has gone to do whatever it is he does out there in the forest that pays him so well.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked who Setarn is...</strong></p>\n<p>Setarn is a Kuboran who lives in Tormau in the style of a civilised man but no one knows quite how he affords it.</p>\n<p><strong>A final word...</strong></p>\n<p>Tursar wishes them well. Perhaps if they find out what happened to Kutz then the tribes will settle down again. If the next season’s trading is disrupted then he will suffer.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Setarn ‘the Kuboran’</strong></h3>\n<p>Setarn is well known in the town and asking almost anyone will reveal that Setarn is a Kuboran who spends a lot of time away from Tormau. Scurrilous rumour says he masterminds the brigandage between Tormau and Ithiko to the south. Others say he has a secret silver mine in the forest from which he regularly recovers a king’s ransom. That’s what keeps him in such style.</p>\n<p>He has a sizable house built a little apart from the rest of the town but it has all the trappings of a successful guildsman, including Rethemi servants.</p>\n<p><strong>If they seek out Setarn at home...</strong></p>\n<p>His servant, a well spoken Rethemi, apologises but his master is away from Tormau at the moment and not expected to return for a ten-day or more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rhetoric</strong></em> may lead the servant to declare that a number of Kubora known to his master have left word for Setarn to say they were leaving Tormau. He doesn’t know why.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>If necessary the GM can use Jamys’ men to find the PCs if they are tardy in collecting the ponies from the Inn by mid-morning. It is important that the GM doesn’t give them too much time to become distracted or to pursue options that will prove ultimately fruitless.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.VLmqHJap0FqY18xq]{Act I - Scene 3: To Quyn Manor}</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.JxnzvlRdXc7ihd4E","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_hatx2zk5zmb","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act I:  Into the Forest","color":"#2db43d","sort":200000}}}

The individualistic Kubora are not suited to formal religion and usually honour their gods as they see fit. The role of the Shaman is more about the practice of Shuntul, and that of the Crone more about mid-wifery and herblore than organised worship. They oversee certain rites but are not ordained clerics in any sense that would be recognised in more civilised lands.</p>\n<p>Heneryne, though, is a complex goddess with many aspects, some of which are bloodthirsty and vengeful.

A slave who was freed when her master died she specialises in excellent stews and breads. Her sobriquet ‘the Lamb’ is an example of Jamys’ humour as she has a foul temper and almost as foul a mouth when in her kitchen.</p>\n<p>Merla can turn her hand to almost any meal be it animal, fish or fowl and has rarely let the reputation of the Stoat slip though at 1d for a meal few can afford her skill. She is also known for the magic she weaves with dough; her bread cakes sweetened with local wild honey (1f) are a prized part of any meal served at the inn.</p>\n<p>Soon after arriving at the Stoat Merla realised that the innkeeper’s ‘associates’ often returned late and in need of a solid meal. She took to keeping a pottage simmering through the night and noticed that this softened cheaper cuts of meat to the delicate and moist succulence of the best. Turning necessity into advantage she is now known across the Shire for her rich and filling pottage (2f). She rules Absel the pot-boy with a rod of iron and it is he who is tasked to stop the pottage burning during the night by stirring it at regular intervals. Absel doesn’t realise it but Merla’s harsh tuition is turning him into an even better cook than she is.</p>\n<p>Jamys is no brewer but has identified the local apothecary, Gweyn of Kesham, as having the talent he lacks. Though not a member of the Innkeeper’s Guild Gweyn brews every second day ‘for her own use’. Surprisingly she always seems to brew far more than she needs and is happy to ‘donate’ the excess to the White Stoat. In return Jamys finds it necessary to buy enormous volumes of linctus and decongestants for his weak chest! The arrangement is, of course, a fiction, but none of the local innkeepers feels it would be in their interest to bring the matter to the attention of the Mangai. Even if they did the local guildsmen know better than the cross the man who offers them such generously hospitality. As well as a tasty small beer (1f) and a stronger dark ale (2f) Gweyn also produces a fine mead (3f) from the same local honey Merla uses in the kitchen.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/scenes/Heart_of_Darkness/White_Stoat_Inn_GM_Map.PNG","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ADDhK0Q9XQkEgxw1","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_b8slu2n3iw","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/The White Stoat Inn","color":"#212121","sort":500000}}}

They intend to arrive at midday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Through the afternoon</strong></h3>\n<p>The journey through the afternoon is uneventful save for a few shouted exchanges of news with the groups of timberwirghts where the Denar river joins the Denia. It is along the Denar that the Earl is allowed to take timber. The Kubora will not stop and the shouted exchanges will add nothing to what the PCs have already found out. The forest around the mouth of the Denar has a gap-toothed appearance where large trees have taken lesser trunks with them when felled. This is the scarring of the land that is making Sir Ardith Serathy of Quyn, as well has his lord the Earl, rich.</p>\n<p>Quickly, though, the timberwrights are left behind and virgin forest grows right down to both the North (left) and South (right) banks. At intervals the guides pause in their paddling as if to listen, an ear cocked first the the left, then even more attentively, to the right bank, which they scan continuously. These pauses lead to little interruption in the pace of travel but the PCs will get the sense that it is with the right bank that the Kubora are concerned.</p>\n<p>As the journey continues <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> will gain a sense that the guides are paying more and more attention to the South bank, but the PCs will not be able to spot what it is that is worrying them.</p>\n<p><strong>If the guides are questioned during the journey...</strong></p>\n<p>They are taciturn and keep their answers to the minimum.  This should be no surprise to the PCs given the apparent lack of competent Hârnic among the Kubora. Even a character versed in Old Jarinese will get little more of a response to most questions.</p>\n<p><strong>If the guides are asked about the south bank...</strong></p>\n<p>Without the Earl’s colours the Suyari would already have shown themselves along the south bank. They will not hear of landing there. The Denia is more than 150 paces wide here and Acurdin will steer a course that keeps the boats closer to the Asawne, or northern, bank.</p>\n<p><strong>If the guides are asked about the Suyari...</strong></p>\n<p>The Suyari are the Kuboran tribe that occupy a range on the other side of the river. They are traditional enemies of the Asawne and a treacherous and dangerous enemy.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Dusk falls</strong></h3>\n<p>The sun sinks early behind the towering trees, and with dusk come swarms of biting insects relishing fresh meat.  They are annoying but ultimately harmless, unless the GM wants an excuse to visit a bout of marsh fever on the PCs in a week or two’s time.</p>\n<p>Acurdin, in the lead boat, angles into the North bank at a point where the tree line is interrupted by a small stream.  A dozen paces into the inlet and the boats are well hidden from the river. It is clear this is a camp often used by travellers as a fire pit waits among the tress a few paces into the trees where the ground is dry.</p>\n<p>The Kubora set about preparing a camp with calm efficiency.  Soon a fire is set and dried meat and grain is softening in boiling water.</p>\n<p>NOTE:  insert some hint of Kuboran ritual by having the PCs observe the following:</p>\n<p>As the camp is being prepared, each Asawne warrior places 1-2 pices of kindling in the hearth, kneeling reverently and mouthing a few words.  By the last warrior, there is a simple ring of kindling which makes up the base of the fire.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color:#191813\">When travelling, women will put down a simple ring of kindling in imitation of a glade before laying a fire atop them and setting camp.

They are still wet from their swim across the Denia.</p>\n<p>One of the \"visitors\" @Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.0x2HmOaJtCo5qMTr]{Gerbold (Suyari Warrior #1)} addresses Acurdin in the fluid vowels of the Kuboran dialect and the guide frowns, but nods.  The other guides look shocked but make no move. Speakers of Old Jarinese will understand that a formal challenge has been issued relating to some slight Acurdin is responsible for.</p>\n<p>Acurdin will turn to the PCs and explain in much better Harnic than he has previously revealed that there is a difficulty.  These Suyari are clan brothers to a warrior he, Acurdin, bested in a game of chance at last year’s gathering of the Kuboran tribes. It was a fair game but the Suyari took it badly and Acurdin had to defend himself and wounded the other man. These Suyari seek to right the wrong they feel marks their clan’s honour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If asked what it will take to 'right the wrong'...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin explains that though the insult was trivial it has grown with the time these Suyari have carried it. He will add that ‘if Crador is indeed to rest’, then honour must be settled. He explains that in other circumstances he would not hesitate to fight one of them, and offer them the chance to make things right by drawing first blood. However he is sworn by his clanhead to avoid placing those in his care - the characters - in jeopardy. Fighting the Suyari risks things going badly and the characters being hurt. He must, therefore, balance two matters of honour: fighting the Suyari and putting the PCs at risk which would dishonour him and his clanhead; or protecting the characters by refusing the challenge and so taking the dishonour on himself.  He can see no way to avoid dishonour but his personal honour is less important than that of his clan would lose if he put the characters at risk though his actions. So, he will refuse the Suyari challenge.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If asked what it will cost him...</strong></p>\n<p>He explains that he had significant status among his people and that will be lost, but that is better than risking the oath his elders shared with the Earl of Tormau. He will not hazard his clan or tribe’s honour on any account.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If asked if one of the guides can be his champion...</strong></p>\n<p>He can’t nominate another of the guides as they are also bound by the oath to protect the PCs rather than put them at risk,. Anyway he would not put his clan brothers in a situation he would not face himself.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the characters offer to join a general melee with the Suyari...</strong></p>\n<p>He will do everything in his power to stop them – including having the guides hold them at weapon point while he disarms them. He explains that any fight to the death will simply turn this matter of honour into a blood feud and that is not what his clan would want.  The GM should beware PCs that take this option despite Acurdin’s efforts as this is very early in the adventure to have the PCs put themselves at such risk.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs ask if they can help...</strong></p>\n<p>This is an opportunity for a PC to offer to face the Suyari in Acurdin’s place. It is permissible for Acurdin to be represented by a champion and if a character made that decision Acurdin’s oath would not be compromised. While he cannot take an action that would put the characters in potential harms way, if one of them offered to accept the challenge on his behalf then he would not be directly responsible for that decision or its consequences.</p>\n<p>If the Suyari won then they would be satisfied; he does not seem to consider what would happen if the PC won - that seems so unlikely to him. Either way he, Acurdin, would still have his honour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the characters won't provide a champion...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin will tell the Suyari he refuses the challenge and they will whoop and holler in derision at his cowardice, lack of honour and likeness to a woman. The Suyari will then demand gifts as proof that they have bested him.  Acurdin is visibly hurt by the taunts and will be much more subdued from this point on. He defers all subsequent leadership to Garach, another of the guides.</p>\n<p>Acurdin will think no worse of the characters if they take this path. They are, after all, southrons who are known to have no understanding of honour. The rest of the adventure will play out as written but where Acurdin or other Kubora have a chance to be more open, understanding or helpful, the GM should limit their actions and make it more challenging for the PCs to gain their assistance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the characters offer to provide a champion...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin is obviously surprised and perhaps a little confused. He didn’t expect this but is grateful and will look on the characters in a new light – not as equals, of course, but certainly as better than he expected.</p>\n<p>He will explain that as the Suyari have issued the challenge it is the PC champion who can chose the nature of the fight. He is clear the warriors will not be satisfied by some riddling or other game - they seek combat. Though the choice of weapons is left to the character the Suyari will be insulted if the choice is a ‘southron weapon’, as they cannot fight with what they do not have.</p>\n<p>Acurdin’s advice is that they should fight bare-handed in the hope that neither is killed. Losing a PC leads to a loss of face for him, while killing a Suyari risks an escalating blood feud. The Suyari will imply a fight to the death if the PC nominates any weapon, including a knife. Bare-handed they will assume the fight is to submission.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the PCs will follow his advice but if not let the combat proceed on their terms. See below for the consequences of not following Acurdin’s advice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Once the champion is identified...</strong></p>\n<p>Having judged the Suyari as leaner and lighter than them the PCs should be confronted by the Suyari champion - who has been lurking out of sight in the trees. He’s a much bigger, heavier man...</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.dGgc4DACNbQWhc1Q]{Suyari Champion}</p>\n<p>The fight should be fought to its conclusion. If the Suyari wins then their honour is assuaged having defeated Acurdin’s champion. If they lose then their reaction can be straight-forward: they lost in a fair fight, or the GM can add a complication.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Potential Complications</strong></h3>\n<p>If the GM wants to give more than just the PC champion a physical workout then the following options can be explored as follow-ups to the events described above.</p>\n<p><strong>If Acurdin refused the challenge...</strong></p>\n<p>Once the Suyari have stopped insulting Acurdin and gloating over him they will demand evidence of their triumph over them.</p>\n<p><strong>If a PCs accepted the challenge on behalf of Acurdin and lost...</strong></p>\n<p>Once the Suyari have stopped insulting the PC for being a weak and womanly southron they will demand evidence of their triumph over him.</p>\n<p><strong>If a PCs accepted the challenge on behalf of Acurdin and won...</strong></p>\n<p>Once the Suyari have picked up their fallen warrior they will demand compensation for having had to face a dishonourable opponent - a southron.</p>\n<p>The only evidence of victory or compensation the Suyari will accept is a piece of the PCs equipment for each Suyari warrior, including those out in the forest. Either a weapon or a piece of armour will suffice.</p>\n<p><strong>In any of the above circumstances...</strong></p>\n<p>The Suyari may be convinced to accept alternatives to the weapons and armour they want; OR</p>\n<p>The Suyari hold out for their initial demands and if the characters won’t comply then they will rollup their sleeves and set out to teach the southrons and their Asawne ‘nursemaids’ a lesson.</p>\n<p><strong>If a general melee breaks out...</strong></p>\n<p>The Suyari want a blood feud no more than the Asawne so the GM should stress that the Suyari move on the PCs bare-handed. They will still have their knives at their belts but will only use them if a PC resorts to their knife first. If the PCs make to use their other weapons then the Suyari will do likewise and someone is likely to end up dead.</p>\n<p>The fight will continue until one side or the other has subdued their opponents or until the GM thinks the PCs either have the upper hand or are at risk of getting badly hurt. In either case the Suyari will look to retreat into the forest with their wounded.</p>\n<p>It is left to the GM to determine the consequences of any blood feued the PCs have triggered, but in future they would be well advised to travel through the Hohnam Blight only in daylight and in a large group!</p>\n<p><strong>The attitude of Acurdin and the other guides...</strong></p>\n<p>It is important to note that Acurdin and the guides are passive observers of any melee resulting from the PCs refusal to hand over any of their possessions. If they take part there is a good chance the feud will re-start and that may end with someone dead and someone else pursued through the forest.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>At the end of the encounter</strong></h3>\n<p>Searching any incapacitated Suyari will yield a small carved wooden token strung on a hide thong. The token has a smiling face on one side and a fanged maw on the reverse and looks to be relatively newly carved. If there is no body left to examine then the PC who acted as champion will later remember seeing a token like this strung around the neck of his Suyari opponent.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.B2s6cQtRVZUGh1iX]{Wooden Token}</p>\n<p>There is some similarity to the token Tursar of Meglese may have shown a character.</p>\n<p><strong>If the guides are asked about the token...</strong></p>\n<p>The guides will dismiss the tokens with a shrug saying that they are just a superstition. Any PC choosing to keep a particular eye on the guides after these events will notice they all wear a similar token.</p>\n<p>Finally, the camp settles to sleep and the PCs will see the Kubora take turns at keeping watch in the forest. It is up to the characters if they wish to stand a watch as well.</p>\n<p>The Kubora will be up before the PCs and prepare a cold breakfast for them before the journey upriver continues, much as it did yesterday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>The next scene is a logical extension of their journey up river.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.fsBFUlQB5NOJ6LUN]{Act II: The Asawne}</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EUiiqCsm7bBjOnFQ","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_hatx2zk5zmb","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act I:  Into the Forest","color":"#2db43d","sort":500000}}}

Another <em><strong>Awareness </strong></em>success will indicate that he is not a Kuboran as he has none of the distinctive facial scarring of Kuboran Arus.</p>\n<p>A short, fat, Rethemi is waiting on the dock as they arrive. He clearly notices the Earl’s colours and introduces himself grandly as <em>Ardo of Guil, mercantyler plenipotentiary of the Earl of Tormau to the clans of the Asawne Kubora</em>. He continues: <em>You are welcome, please accept my hospitality.</em></p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.ZUFbVpTloj120wKA]{Ardo of Guil}</em></p>\n<p><em>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.QyjB7zs3Clp6X2sW]{Ardo of Guil}</em></p>\n<p>It is clear that Ardo’s invitation is aimed at the PCs not the Kuboran guides who are left to make their own arrangements. It will also be clear that he views any tribal PC as beneath his notice and will offer them neither hospitality nor conversation unless prompted. Then he will treat them like the PC’s servant, not an equal.</p>\n<p>The GM should vary this attitude if there are no nontribal PCs present but otherwise it should be used to communicate Ardo’s low opinion of ‘barbarians’ and his pretensions to leading a ‘civilised’ life in which everyone has a place in the recognised social order. It also reflects his view of how high he stands in that social order, despite appearances to the contrary!</p>\n<p><strong>If Ardo is asked about the body outside...</strong></p>\n<p>He explains that every so often some freebooter chances his arm when he learns the black and yellow colours of the Earl can offer some protection from the tribes.</p>\n<p>The one outside was only expecting to encounter some dim barbarians rather than an agent of the Earl himself.  The man had no proof of his connection to the Earl so Ardo disowned him. The poor devil was handed over to the Kuboran women and treated as an oath-breaker. It took him a week to die and the Kubora will display his body there as a sign to their gods of their distaste for liars.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ardo's hut and trading post</strong></h3>\n<p>The Earl of Tormau retains Ardo as a representative to trade with the tribes. It is here that the Earl sends gifts of weapons and other trade goods in return for licence for his timberwrights to log downstream.</p>\n<p>Ardo’s trading post is a typical, if large, Kuboran roundhouse, perhaps 20 feet across with the centre pole rising almost 10 feet above the floor. Half the hut is crowded with bales of skins, other products of the forest, and trade goods of one kind or another; the other has a low pallet and a table on which an open ledger sits. Ardo ostentatiously closes the ledger when the PCs enter and the woman who was stirring a pot over the fire pit near the centre of the hut retreats into the shadows where she sits quietly on the pallet and begins repairing some of Ardo’s clothes.</p>\n<p>He is a scruffy individual though he would claim he seeks to keep up civilised standards in this barbarian backwater. He is clearly interested in the PCs as his only other ‘civilised’ company arrives every season or so when the Earl sends more trade goods up river.</p>\n<p>Once the PCs are settled he asks if the PCs have anything for him, some sign that you are truly from the Earl. Handing over the letter they received from Jamys will satisfy Ardo and he files the letter safely in the ledger.</p>\n<p>He is a deeply officious individual and, having verified the PCs credentials, he will then insist on recording their names. If they object he will explain that he is accountable for relations with these natives and if the PCs cause trouble while here he will be answerable for it. By taking their names he ensures he can point his finger at the true trouble makers. He is, of course, certain that this will be unnecessary in the case of his current visitors but precautions must be taken.</p>\n<p>The PCs should see his practice of taking names as a way of confirming whether Kutz came this way and when.</p>\n<p>Once he has recorded the PCs in his ledger he will happily answer any questions but the lucidity of his answers will decline as he works his way through a bottle of liquor he keeps for special occasions such as this. It is all too clear that Ardo defines special occasions loosely as there are several empty liquor flasks visible in the hut. It is a rough spirit he ‘prepares locally’ and PCs should moderate their intake if they are not to fall into the same stupor as him by the end of the meal.</p>\n<p><strong>If they ask about Kutz...</strong></p>\n<p>Kutz came up river a number of times on the Earl’s business and used the Asawne camp as a base for journeys to many of the neighbouring tribes. The local chief is an ally of the Earl and supports the Earl’s efforts to make alliances with the Kubora.</p>\n<p>Then, last Summer, Kutz came with a group of men, maybe a few more than a handful, and an unlikely companion in the form of a scribe who kept making notes in a book he carried with him everywhere. He said they were heading further up river rather than into the forest.</p>\n<p>Ardo warned Kutz that the Kubora say there’s nothing good up river but he wouldn’t be swayed. He was going to raise an army, he said, to crush the usurper Chafin. He had weapons and lots of supplies in his boats but they weren’t for the Asawne. He took them with him. The mercantyler hasn’t heard anything of him since. He got a letter from Tormau last season asking if he had heard anything but wrote back explaining the man had disappeared.</p>\n<p>He has no idea what happened to Kutz, but there have been some disturbing rumours that he hears through his Kuboran woman.</p>\n<p><strong>If they ask about recent events...</strong></p>\n<p>Things have got more tense lately; the warriors have been restless but no one will tell him why. What he does know is that a number of debts are being settled – sometimes bloodily. He’s more nervous than he has been in all his time at the village. He’s taken to sleeping with his dagger under his pillow, just in case.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about the tokens...</strong></p>\n<p>He has noticed them a lot over the last season. Mothers carve them for their children and even the warriors wear them. Some are carved with a sun and moon; some with a friendly face and a fearsome one; some with trees and lots of game and then trees but no game.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked who leads the village...</strong></p>\n<p>The village clanhead is Gomas, called Straight Arrow, who is also Hanuhn of the Asawne. He is currently residing in the village.</p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>The GM can encourage the PCs to wander around the village by having Ardo’s woman hustle them out of the hut so she can put him to bed.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.taXiaGqk8TdpIILS]{Act II - Scene 2: Making Friends?}</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/actors/NPCs/Heart%20of%20Darkness/Ardo%20of%20Guil%20v2.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EZTy3d7fyFXxM2s8","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6sup32vavy3","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act II:  The Asawne","color":"#30832a","sort":175000}}}

It sits on the north bank of the River Denia where it is joined by the Quyn stream. The tributary is clogged with tree trunks felled upriver by treaty with the Asawne Kubora.</p>\n<p>It isn’t difficult to spot their guides - a group of Kubora hunkered down beside the timber dock near where several hide boats are drawn up on the bank.</p>\n<p><strong>Kuboran PCs</strong> will be viewed as capable but not worthy of friendship as they have clearly given up the true life of a Kuboran in favour of service to southrons.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Kuboran PCs</strong> will be partonised by the guides.  They will assume the southrons are incapable of managing much for themselves and need help with the simplest tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Kuborans from another tribal background</strong> will be treated with suspicion, not just patronised. The Kubora are almost more xenophobic about their Urdu neighbours than about southrons and they will assume that other tribes beyond their experience are as untrustworthy as the Urdu.</p>\n<p>Their leader waits for the PCs to approach before seeming to take any notice of them.</p>\n<p><strong>If the leader is questioned...</strong></p>\n<p>He reveals he is Acurdin of the Asawne tribe of the Kubora, and that his clan brothers are also Asawne. He has been told to wait until the middle of the afternoon and then safely transport the group up-river to one of his tribe’s villages.  He has given an oath to fulfil this mission.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked whether he serves the Earl...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin will spit copiously and deny serving ‘southrons’</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs seek a delay...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin will say his instructions are clear: wait until mid-afternoon and then carry the southrons up stream. If no one arrives at the appointed time, they will leave anyway.</p>\n<p>If they do not wish to travel then they cannot be those he is expecting and he will leave.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked if he is expecting them...</strong></p>\n<p>The leader nods and begins to efficiently arrange for the ponies to be left at the manor; the loading of the PCs gear aboard the boats and, within 30 minutes, of largely silent activity is ready to depart. He, and his fellows, are a surly bunch communicating with gesture and expression as much as with words, and he’s not much more communicative with the PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>If a PC speaks Jarinese or Old Jarinese...</strong></p>\n<p>Communication will be easier as the Kubora give every impression of barely understanding Harnic. Further questioning of their leader, however, will reveal that he speaks better Harnic than initially seemed the case.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Preparing for the journey</strong></h3>\n<p>The boats are light but sturdy craft called curach by both the Rethemi and the Kubora. Built on a bent willow frame the hides are sealed with organic wax or oil which renders them entirely waterproof. They can carry two passengers and their gear along with a Kuboran with a paddle at either end to provide motive power and steering. The number of boats and guides should be varied to accommodate the number of PCs.</p>\n<p>They have a broad beam and shallow draft which makes them quite stable on the water and ideal for river travel.  The Kubora clearly travel light having little more than a bedroll, a javelin, hand axe and round shield.</p>\n<p>The PCs should decide who is travelling in which boat and the order of the boats once on the river. Acurdin will take the rear place in the lead boat.</p>\n<p><strong>If a PCs tries to board wearing metal armour...</strong></p>\n<p>He will be told with brisk gestures that this puts them, and more importantly the balance of the boat, at risk and they should stow it with their gear.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs fail to follow this advice...</strong></p>\n<p>Any PC who refuses to follow this advice will be told to walk along the bank. Within a league that will become impossible as the heat is such that heavy armour will generate <em><strong>Fatigue</strong></em> at an increasing rate. Forest encounters can also be used to help the PC realise that wearing armour in these conditions makes no sense if it isolates him from the people who know the locale best – the guides.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs need to don armour while on the boats</strong></p>\n<p>With the exception of helmets, metal armour stowed on the boats cannot be safely donned until back on solid ground.  Were a PC to be unwise enough to try to get into armour while on the boats then they should be required to make a successful <em><strong>STUMBLE</strong></em> and <em><strong>FUMBLE</strong></em> roll for each area of the body covered to avoid falling overboard &amp;/or dropping their armour into the water and seeing it sink without a trace.</p>\n<p><strong>Just before they board the boats for the journey</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin gives each PC a piece of cloth, dyed black and muddy yellow; the Earl’s colours. They are told to display it prominently so it can be seen from the south bank of the river.

{"_id":"WjOTwMxPFCvjwn1f","name":"Clan Gomas:  Village","content":"<p>The village of the Asawne Hanuhn, Gomas, called ‘Straight Arrow’, is home to 19 households and almost the same number of unmarried warriors.  The extended households occupy larger round-houses but by tradition the unmarried warriors live separately from their father’s household in smaller huts around the periphery of the village’s stockaded redoubt. There they act as the first line of warning and defence against attack from the forest.</p>\n<p>Within the village’s protective ditch and bank boundary are well tended vegetable plots that supplement meat gained from the hunt. They comprise orderly rows of beans and gourds and some cereals, from which a portion of seed is collected annually for sowing the following year. During most days in the growing and harvest seasons the able bodied women and their daughters are to be found tending these plots, watched over by the clan’s Hearth Guard. This is as organised as Kuboran agriculture gets and the only skill gained during its sojourn in ‘civilisation’ with Arlun that is still valued.</p>\n<p>Across the stream on which one flank of the stockade rests is the cleared forest in which the clans semi-domesticated cattle graze. Hogs forage beyond the ditches of the vegetable plots. Both are watched over by the younger boys who will raise the alarm and run to fetch the Hearth Guard if danger threatens.</p>\n<p>As the Asawne, like even the most settled Kubora, practice no crop rotation the yield from their cultivation can decline quickly. Then the village is moved onto the cattle grazing area where their dung has improved the fertility and cultivation begins afresh. All along this stretch of the Denia abandoned village sites can be found dating back to Arlun’s invasion and the Asawne return. They sit in clearings that have been absorbed back into the wilderness. The most recent previous site is in what is now the cattle grazing and was abandoned about 5 years ago. The foundations of roundhouses can still be found there.</p>\n<p>Nearer the river is a stout 5’ wooden palisade on a bank above a flooded ditch. The palisade has two gates: the main one to the southwest and a smaller ‘stranger gate’ to the north.</p>\n<p>In time of attack the clan will seek shelter within this palisaded redoubt. If sorely pressed the warriors would buy time for the women, children and the old to escape onto the river.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.ZkC6fUcji0ASmwVk]{01 Village - Cattle Grazing}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.W1YTsQuokS5qcMbZ]{02 Village - Hogs Copse}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.FTcWj1h9Q6onUJhh]{03 Village - Heneryne's Glade}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.YgWgtFVxSG4jZdgs]{04 Village - Hunter's Path}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.8HtCqweAEpTN8lAu]{05a Village - Stranger's Beach}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.dli8avGRTzWDLE80]{05b Village - Trading Post}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.LxyHeNGIzc3vnmEx]{05c Village - Shuntul Lodge}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.jnNIZurfQllcmYEG]{05d Village - Hunuhn's Round-house}</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.GZN2jADsVLMPfnPN","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0b2m4o5az66m","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Asawne Kubora","color":"#1723c4","sort":350000}}}

That may explain why, today, the Denal consider it taboo to marry outside the clan, let alone into another tribe.</p>\n<p>The Denal say that ‘if one brother is tenau and another anghenfil then between them they have the wit of any normal man’. This is not intended cruelly. The Denal have long accepted that each birth brings something different, but equally essential, to the tribe.

They are equally at home in the forest, the marsh, or the water.</p>\n<p><strong>If questioned on the Denal Kubora...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin is reticent but as the sun sinks and the drums go silent he tells tales of this mysterious Kuboran tribe with villages that ‘float’ on the marsh.</p>\n<p>The Denal are fierce, independent, and hostile to almost anyone approaching their range unless they bring a ‘gift of sacrifice for the Hand of Crador’. If other Kubora wish to trade then they travel to the head of the cataract and wait there for the Denal to approach them.</p>\n<p>The Denal are not liked by their neighbours; having a fearsome reputation among the tribes. Only a small number of warriors travel to Kustan each year and they come to trade furs, bog iron and herbs, not women. It is said around the fires of the Asawne that they breed with the marsh ogres that stalk the reed beds.</p>\n<p>Legend tells that ‘Crador the Blind’ haunts the marshes and it is from here that he sends bad dreams or good luck depending on his capricious nature. Some tribes believe he can been encouraged to send good luck in return for a ‘gifts’, but Gomas teaches that men make their own luck.</p>\n<p>Acurdin will gesture to the tokens the PCs were given when they left the village. Like all the wooden discs the PCs have seen they display a ‘positive’ images on one side and a ‘negative’ image on the other: a smiling face and a fanged maw; a sun and a moon; plentiful game and an empty forest scene. He explains that they show two possible futures: good luck or good hunting; and bad luck, hunger or fear. They represent the two sides of Crador: restful dreams and nightmares. Kubora believe that they protect them from the worst of Crador’s excesses by showing respect for the god’s power.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about the ‘Hand of Crador’...</strong></p>\n<p>Somewhere, deep in the marsh, is Crador’s home. In Kuboran lore it is called the ‘Hand of Crador’. Acurdin knows no more than that, except that the southrons who came to the forest long ago sought to find it and defile it.</p>\n<p><strong>If Acurdin is asked if he will accompany them tomorrow...</strong></p>\n<p>If the PCs helped him with the Suyari he will agree but even if they didn’t he will demonstrate Kuboran superiority and say ‘We are better than southrons, I will aid you in your time of need’.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Later that night</strong></h3>\n<p>It is deepest night when Acurdin wakes the PCs to quietly tell them that two of the guides have not returned from their watch; he believes they are all in danger. He had hoped that the Denal would believe the boy, Gedis, was a ‘gift’ and leave them undisturbed until tomorrow. That the Denal have come in the night means they have not been taken in and are not willing to negotiate. He can only buy time by becoming the hunter rather than remaining the hunted.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.kgyfHV6yJWMgX2aj]{The Forest by moonlight}</p>\n<p>As the PCs stir they hear again the high pitched plucked notes of the Denal string-drum, but much nearer and in the forest behind them. Acurdin calmly tells them to arm themselves; he must be worried.</p>\n<p>He and the remaining guides will go into the trees; get behind the Denal; and drive them onto the PC’s swords.</p>\n<p><strong>If cautioned on this course of action...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin will say that the Denal only come at night if they intend to kill. He will not sit and wait for the blade to fall, like a prey animal.</p>\n<p>Once he and his men have gone into the trees the PCs are to light the bonfire so that they have light if it comes to a fight. He and the others then disappear into the trees.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs offer to go into the forest...</strong></p>\n<p>Acurdin will grin in the firelight and shake his head. He and the guides have the best chance of getting past and behind the Denal.</p>\n<p><strong>After the guides have gone into the forest...</strong></p>\n<p>The next 20 minutes crawl by; <em><strong>HEARING x 2</strong></em> will reveal a few soft groans or grunts off in the trees and then the creaking of, perhaps, tree boughs? Then silence.</p>\n<p>The substantial bonfire means that <em><strong>within 10 feet there is no penalty for poor light; for another 10 feet beyond that there is a 20% physical penalty for tasks relying on sight; and beyond that the penalty doubles to 40%.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Over the crackle and roar of the bonfire it is difficult to hear anything from the forest. Nearer the forest there is only an ominous, almost physical, silence seeming to flow out from among the trees. 10 minutes, then 20 more pass.  Then an hour and the forest remains preternaturally quiet. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs decide to set off after Acurdin...</strong></p>\n<p>The PCs should <em><strong>suffer the 40% penalty</strong></em> due to poor light unless they have torches/lanterns which remove the penalty if they are only finding their way among the trees.  Once they engage <em><strong>in combat the penalty returns to 30%</strong></em> as the light sources swing and sway back an forth.</p>\n<p>Having the <em><strong>light bearer stand aloof from a fight reduces the penalty to 10%</strong></em>. Anyone with combat experience will know they are better off near the fire where they at least have a chance. If the boy, Gedis, is with them they should consider his fate if he were abandoned at the camp.</p>\n<p>If, despite these concerns, they brave the forest at night the GM should make copious use of <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> rolls to imply that there is movement around them, just beyond the illumination of their lanterns/torches; perhaps trying to get between them and the camp.</p>\n<p><strong>If they try it without light...</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Stealth and AGL</strong></em> are needed to avoid making noises, tripping over roots, getting caught in a thicket of thorns etc.  <em><strong>CF</strong></em> should involve some minor injury from these trips, falls, scratches etc. and add to the physical penalty. <em><strong>Survival </strong></em>should be used to avoid losing contact with other PCs.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs persevere in the forest...</strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that the PCs will be lost in the dark and, hopefully, isolated from one another. At that point they should again start making <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> rolls suggesting that there are ‘things’ all around them. <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> will allow them to locate the glow from the bonfire and make their way back to it.</p>\n<p><strong>If instead they wait for dawn...</strong></p>\n<p>Regular <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> rolls should lead to the camp being roused repeatedly through the night as one guard after another is certain they heard something moving through the trees towards the camp. This can be amplified if, as the night goes on, the available fire-wood begins to run out and the darkness edges closer and closer to the PCs. At dawn they will be exhausted (no Fatigue recovery).</p>\n<p>There is no sign of the Kuboran guides.</p>\n<p><strong>If they explore the forest at dawn...</strong></p>\n<p>As they work their way into the forest they will find the bodies of the guides. How far they get down the following list depends on the strength of their stomach, their nerve, and the number of guides that accompanied them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A guide impaled on a set of sharpened stakes propelled out of the undergrowth by a thick bough that two PCs together would struggle to bend back.</li>\n<li>Another is pinned to the tree with a fire hardened spear that has gone right through his chest and wedged into a crack in the bark beyond; the spear is bigger than a tall man might comfortably wield.</li>\n<li>A guide is crushed against the bole of a tree as if by a chunk of lumber, of which there is no sign;</li>\n<li>A patch of undergrowth that is unnaturally wet … with blood. The rest of the guides, including Acurdin, hang by their feet from the branches above; their throats cut.  Blood drips sluggishly from the carved wooden token hanging around Acurdin’s neck. All have also been gutted; their still steaming guts lie a few yards away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>The PCs may want to collect the bodies for burial, though they know little of Kuboran burial practice which favours exposure in the forest, or they may simply wish to run screaming back to the camp. Whatever they do their route should take them back to remains of the bonfire past the guide pinned to the tree by the large spear. The spear is gone.</p>\n<p>Whatever killed him is still out there...that is usually enough to drive the PCs out onto the marsh, if only to put distance between themselves and whatever lurks in the forest. In the dawn light a number of narrow channels can be seen leading from the lagoon beside the Place of Farewells into the marsh.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.05zFW1cemj2uJfaw]{Dawn Across the Denia Marsh}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.SuxXKXKd3kbLN11H]{Act IV: The Marshes}</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/actors/NPCs/Heart%20of%20Darkness/Ardo%20of%20Guil%20v2.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lVSshmEpt9K0gmBf","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_3t0858bnqro","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act III:  Further Upstream","color":"#4f86b0","sort":400000}}}

However, as his sobriquet indicates, this big man lives for the opportunity to lead his clan in war. He relies heavily on Acurdin ‘the Guide’, who knows the clan’s range better than anyone else living, to help deploy the warriors for the hunt. Some say Acurdin knows where every animal and bird nests, burrows or roosts. Certainly the trap lines he sets have a remarkably high success rate. Rytog doesn’t fear Acurdin, realising that the thoughtful younger man is more likely to succeed Gomas than him.</p>\n<p>There are usually hunting parties of between 10 and 15 warriors as far as a day away from the village. The others remain within an hour or so of the village, able to return quickly if the Hearth Guard calls for them with the village’s signal drums. It is the older men of the Guard who routinely oversee the grazing beyond the ditch and the river approach.</p>\n<p>Those youths old enough to be given duties beyond cattle watching will be divided between the hunters and the Hearth Guard depending on their skills, talent and how close they are to their Dynoldeb (manhood) ceremony.  However close they are to that important rite of passage they remain armed only with short bows and knives until they earn the right to bear the arms of a man.</p>\n<p>Because Gomas ‘Striaght Arrow’ is the tribal Hanuhn the other clans send a much lauded warrior to form his honour guard of 4 warriors. They live in his round-house as members of his household and travel everywhere with him. Unusually the warrior from clan Derel is <em>meinirhyfel</em>; a woman who has put aside her femaleness and chosen the path of the warrior and hunter. Sytari is an attractive woman in her 20’s who Acurdin ‘The Guide’ wishes to marry.  Unfortunately to earn the privilege of courting any <em>meinirhyfel</em> the man must subdue her in combat. That is something Acurdin is none too sure he could achieve. Instead he pays Syarti careful respect as a fellow hunter and looks for any sign from her that his advances would be welcomed.</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.HxuoClBKvpgRvTjr","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0b2m4o5az66m","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Asawne Kubora","color":"#1723c4","sort":400000}}}

He has recorded everything he remembers of their journey into the forest and events since. Unfortunately he long ago used up all the pages in his journal as well as the ink he brought with him. For most of the last season he has been re-using pages by writing first in the margins and then between other lines of text. He is also using ‘ink’ squeezed from the base of a variety of purple stemmed reed. Together these factors make his journal largely unintelligible to anyone but him. Another reader will find the narrative appears to jump about and be interspersed with poems and other writings that are barely legible given that the reed ink is very poor and fades quickly. That doesn’t bother ‘Den’ as it simply leaves more space for his to re-use.</p>\n<p>His obsessive writing and re-writing means that he could recite the entire tale; but the book appears to be important to him as a key to his memories. At important points in his narrative he will refer to his notes though <em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> will show his finger often follows bare space where words may once have been written.</p>\n<p>Once the PCs are settled around him within the Shuntul Hut where he has been living as a guest they will be served a bitter vegetable broth in which pieces of fish float. It appears wholesome and filling if not very tasty.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Survival, Alchemical skill or Herblore</strong></em> might allow a PC to confirm it is not, as far as they know, poisonous, though there is a taint within anything made with the marsh waters that may have an effect on them were they to spend their lives here.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> will reveal that the walkway outside the hut is crowded with Denal listening, even though they probably don’t understand the Harnic Den uses.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>The Fate of Coln Kutz</strong></h3>\n<p>As they talk with Den it will be clear that he is quite mad. He has spent several weeks here, alone, since Kutz left with no one but the Denal to talk to and nothing to do but write and take the herbal preparation the Denal use for ceremonial purposes. It is rich in a plant related to fanosel, to which he is now hopelessly addicted, and which leaves him prone to flashbacks and hallucinations.</p>\n<p>This makes his story even more difficult to follow as he speaks in a continuous stream of consciousness from which the PCs can pick some details...</p>\n<p><em>‘Ohhhhh! we came a long way – Ohhhhh! we came a very long way – up the river – we lost friends – found monsters – found friends.</em></p>\n<p><em>The demons came – came to eat. It was only me – me and him – he’s a great man – a great, great man – misunderstood – but a great man – he knows destiny – he knows he has a purpose – he dreamed it ... Ohhhh! The tragedy of it the tragedy and the horror; the horror of it all.</em></p>\n<p><em>They saw his purpose and then he followed the dream’.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There is much more like this and though the PCs may try Rhetoric (diplomacy, command or intimidation) to speed up the telling they will fail. Den has had the tale he wants to tell running around inside his head for months and now the dam is broken and it flows out, unstoppable. The PCs may as well seek to ask a river to reach its destination more quickly as question Den in an effort to shorten his tale. Over the next few hours the PCs put together the following picture of events...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kutz and his party made their way up river much as the PCs have. Their mission was to reinforce alliances with the Asawne on the north bank and the Suyari on the south bank of the Denia but then, to go deeper into Peran. They were to skirt the marshes to meet the Oncade and Garao Kubora to the North. They were to complete their circle of the marshes to bring the Earl’s friendship to the Samasdin, Chetulli, Sangic and Delerni Kubora. Then they were to return to Tormau with news of the alliances the Earl hoped for. They were expected to return before Winter.</li>\n<li>They were to meet an Oncade Kubora hunting party at the top of the Denia cataract but when they arrived the Oncade were not there. They pushed on towards the marsh hoping to find signs of the Oncade and that night they camped at the edge of the marsh. That was when the first attack came. Several men were killed and the following morning they found the Oncade much as the PCs found Acurdin and the other guides.</li>\n<li>They struck off, around the marsh, aiming for the high ground to the north; the edge of the Oncade and Garao ranges. Over the next few days they were picked off one by one. Each morning those killed the day before were laid out, mutilated, for them to find.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PCs gather that from this point on Den’s sanity began to crack and his tale gets less precise and more allegorical and dreamlike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When only he and Kutz remained the Denal came for them in daylight for the first time. Instead of finishing them quickly one of ‘skinny ones’; the Denal Tenau made signs that invited them to surrender and promised their safety. They had no alternative so Kutz agreed and they were carried to this village by reed boat.</li>\n<li>They weren’t fed much but whatever they were given seemed to have something in it that kept them half conscious.</li>\n<li>Gradually they were trusted not to be bound and they were drugged less often. Den began to try to speak to the Denal that watched them and began to pick up some of their obscure dialect of Old Jarinese.</li>\n<li>They began to exchange stories until Den realised that some of the stories he was being told seemed to relate to Kutz, to him and to some other group of ‘outsiders’.</li>\n<li>One story told of a saviour who would free the Denal from their servitude to Crador described as ‘like but unlike; Anghenfil and Tenau, with a storyteller to tell the story’. He thought that described Kutz: big like a Denal anghenfil, but a leader like the tenau.</li>\n<li>He told Kutz these stories and then the mercenary said he’d begun to dream about the future when under the influence of the Denal hallucinogen. He said someone came to him and whispered to him in the dark telling him there was something he had to do.</li>\n<li>When those dreams were told to the Denal the clanhead, Edak, came to see Kutz and Den translated between them.</li>\n<li>They asked if Kutz was ‘<em>the Key to the Lock that bound them</em>’ and ‘<em>the Gatekeeper who would battle the outsiders and bring the god his rest</em>’.</li>\n<li>Kutz seemed to have some sort of revelation and announced he was ‘The Gatekeeper’ and he would go in search of the ‘Outsiders’. Once he had defeated them he would rid the marsh of its evil once and for all.</li>\n<li>The old Denal that had come to see him said this was proof that ‘<em>Crador will rest</em>’ and ‘<em>the good news must pass among the tribes of the People</em>’.</li>\n<li>Kutz left for the ‘<em>Broken Lands to the East</em>’ nearly a month ago and hasn’t come back.</li>\n<li>Before he left he told Den that he had dreamed a way to protect the old scribe. Den draws back the ragged sleeve to reveal a crudely applied tattoo of a frowning face. On his other forearm is its smiling twin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I<strong>f the PC’s ask why the Denal have spared them...</strong></p>\n<p>Suddenly Den appears entirely lucid and logical and he tells them that a few days ago a tenau came to him and said he would have visitors ‘from his previous life, from the outside’. He was frightened but now that they have arrived he is glad to have been able to tell his story.</p>\n<p>He tells them that tomorrow they will be asked an important question on which their fate will hinge. If they give the right answer they will be taken to find Kutz so they can fight him; if they give the wrong answer they will be killed.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PC’s ask what the question will be...</strong></p>\n<p>Den will smile and say: ‘They think you are the ‘Outsiders’ and that Kutz has not succeeded and returned in triumph because he has not been able to find you. They will take you to him.</p>\n<p>Having sipped his narcotic brew throughout the hours it has taken to tell his story Den is now barely conscious. As he finally slips into narcotic fuelled dreaming, his journal slips from his hand. It falls open on the last page where there is a section of clear, lucid, prose …</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>The Song of the Falling God</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Long ago, when the Kubora knew nothing of The Land of Trees and Plenty and the Old Ones of the Forest made their home there, as they had for eternity. Then there was a great battle in the skies and a god was cast down. His club fell to earth at the head of the Great River and the land drew itself up to the East as it feared the club. The River rose to drown the god for it knew him as not Good - but he did not die.</em></p>\n<p><em>When Crador was driven to the marshes by the Denal of old he became one with the Falling God who slept the sleep of ages and dreamed many dreams. Only his Hand tells of his resting place as he reaches for the Light. From it dark dreams stalk the Land and bad luck flows into the Waters.</em></p>\n<p><em>To make his slumber long and make better dreams and luck sacrifice must be made. This is what the Kubora learned when they came to The Land of Trees and Plenty and this is the lore they have followed.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Denal are the Guardians and the Cursed of the Hand but one day a Gate Keeper shall appear and He shall be Like but Unlike, Denal but not Denal, and he shall be the Key. He will seek out the Outsiders and defeat them and then Crador will rest.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The spell is broken by the loud snore and a Denal woman enters and lays the mad-man to rest on the reed pallet that is his bed. There is almost reverence in her actions. She leaves several woven reed blankets for the PCs and leaves them to sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>If they decide to try to escape their fate...</strong></p>\n<p>A generous GM might allow them to escape to their boats and leave the marsh, but one who wishes to have them see the adventure through to its conclusion can use Denal anghenfil to discourage escape. The want them to have a chance to answer their important question on the morrow so every effort will be made to subdue, rather than kill, them.</p>\n<p><strong>If they decide to face their fate...</strong></p>\n<p>Though they may be expecting a climatic confrontation at dawn they will be left to their own devices through the morning. Denal will keep a close eye on them and efforts to escape can be dealt with as above. None of the Denal will talk to them at all. Until their status is confirmed the villagers are caught between disdain and awe.  Den will repeat any of his story given the chance but the patience of even the most understanding character will be tried by his ramblings.</p>\n<p>Finally, near noon, several reed boats appear at the edge of the lagoon accompanied by several anghenfil swimming alongside.</p>\n<p>The PCs are herded down onto the central raft and all the Denal of the village sit on the walkways around them expectantly.</p>\n<p>The reed boats deliver two old Denal the PCs have not seen before. They are accompanied by a body guard of Denal of typical Kuboran build (1 per PC) and Anghenfil (1 per PC).</p>\n<p>After paying their respects to the village elder and to the village ‘glade of Heneryne’ they introduce themselves using Den as an interpreter.</p>\n<p>They are Edak the Stalker – Hanuhn of the Denal Kubora, and Guran Water Walker, the Denal Druhn. Den will add that these are ‘the Great Men’ among the Denal and the ones who came to talk to Kutz.</p>\n<p>After a reverent silence the tenau, Edak, asks a deceptively simple question of the PCs through Den: ‘<em>Are you the Outsiders spoken of in our tales of the past and future?</em>’</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs answer ‘No’...</strong></p>\n<p>Edak asks a second question: ‘<em>So you are trespassers in the lands of the Denal?</em>’</p>\n<p>This gives the PCs a chance to backtrack before they are attacked by the bodyguards and every able bodied Denal present. Any that survive will be hunted mercilessly to the edge of the Denal range and then left to make their way back to civilisation as best they can.</p>\n<p>A frustrated GM might allow them to escape but find that they are herded by the Denal towards the Broken Lands to the East. The Denal see no reason why these new ‘gifts’ should not find their fate with Crador, even if they are not the ‘Outsiders’ spoken of in legend.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs answer ‘Yes’...</strong></p>\n<p>Edak smiles broadly and says ‘<em>Truly Crador may yet rest! You will be taken to the Gatekeeper</em>’.</p>\n<p>The Denal break into fevered activity and within 30 minutes the PCs and their equipment are back aboard either their boats or those of the Denal and part of a convoy travelling swiftly east. Even Den Hapra is brought with them as an interpreter, not that there is much conversation during the journey.</p>\n<p>Only Gedis remains behind. The Denal refuse outright to allow Gedis to accompany them implying that it is too dangerous for a child and he cannot be one of the ‘outsiders’ spoken of in legend. The PCs, though, are left in no doubt that he will be safe with them and when Kutz has killed them he will be sent down to river to ‘his own people’.</p>\n<p>Edak and Guran and their bodyguards as well as most adult males from the village go with them. A few hours later they visit another, larger settlement and are joined by a third old man: a tenau who is introduced as Garras Reed Weaver.</p>\n<p>The Hanuhn and Druhn seem to defer to Garras from now on and the PCs get the impression that he has some special role or responsibility relating to the Broken Lands.  Den Hapra confirms that this was the third ‘great man’ to visit Kutz and question him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>The trigger to the next scene is agreement to be transported there by the Denal. If the PCs begin to have second thoughts the GM can remind them that making their way back the way they have come will be much more difficult than going along with the Denal plan and then running east and south to escape the marsh!</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.DRYF0EhmD1Sc3omz]{Act V: The Broken Lands}</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/actors/NPCs/Heart%20of%20Darkness/Ardo%20of%20Guil%20v2.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YsiduPmfULu4Kbcj","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_nj3o97759hk","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act IV:  The Marshes","color":"#b63e20","sort":200000}}}

Even the unconnected know the White Stoat is the best inn in Tormau; frequented by better off locals. Depending on PC backgrounds this will either be an entirely appropriate location for a meeting or a very great privilege.</p>\n<p>Jamys maintains a snug bar next to the Inn’s common room where he can be assured of quiet when conducting Lia-Kavair, or other confidential, business. By tradition no one enters the snug without his express invitation, and it is that invitation he has extended to the PCs.</p>\n<p>The <em>White Stoat Inn</em> includes maps of the inn and details of its inhabitants and their business.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.jSbPA8G1ciXPc21D]{The White Stoat Inn - INTRO}</p>\n<h3><strong>GM Aims</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>To paint Jamys as an ‘honest rogue’ who has nothing to gain by lying to the PCs, but none-the-less a bad enemy to make.</li>\n<li>To prompt the PCs to consider some of the possible sources of information around Tormau.</li>\n<li>To provide the PCs with sufficient information to help them prepare as bets they can in the available time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>PC Outcomes</strong></h3>\n<p>They accept a well remunerated job and gain a few clues worthy of investigation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scene(s)</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">The common room and snug bar of The White Stoat Inn</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3><strong>Description of Events</strong></h3>\n<p>Jamys is a heavy set man with an imposing presence and darkly charismatic looks. He wears his hair well shorn to disguise his thinning pate. He has a marked Golothan accent.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.bL1RtVhXQl8zW1kS]{Jamys of Abrant}</p>\n<p>Two minders sit in the corner of the snug playing a game of dice and apparently ignoring Jamys and the PCs.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.nMnuLSAwDFlDhiXe]{Minder 1 - Nath of Rysten}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.psivNB5Kg9WRsNA0]{Minder 2 - Merwas of Chornic}</p>\n<p><em><strong>Awareness</strong></em> shows these two are actually keenly observing the PCs and that the bulges under their jerkins are hefty clubs.</p>\n<p>The Innkeeper explains that he has been asked to gather a small group willing to go up river into Kuboran territory on an errand ‘<em>for a powerful patron</em>’. He is not prepared to be more explicit about the commission until he has the PC’s commitment. The remuneration Jamys is offering is good (precise details of the level of reward are left to the GM so that it can be set at a level the party cannot easily turn-down but that equally does not put campaign balance at risk).</p>\n<p>His most enticing suggestion is that ‘<em>if you take their penny and fulfil your part, then you will have gained important friends</em>’.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Intrigue</strong></em> reveals that Jamys is said to enjoy cordial relations with the constable of Caer Tormau but he will neither confirm nor deny that the commission comes from the castle. Everyone knows that Denyl Lynnaeus, Earl of Tormau, is the most important noble in the north-west of Rethem and his favour is not to be turned aside without good cause.</p>\n<p>If the PCs decline to accept the mission then Jamys will tell them politely but firmly that his business with them is concluded. He warns them that he hears any whisper of this conversation repeated he will have them killed. His tone is so matter of fact that it is impossible not to take him seriously; the two minders can be seen smiling over their dice.</p>\n<p>If the PCs say they will take on the mission but back out later then they can expect to be run out of Tormau by the garrison of the Caer with few if any of their possessions; Jamys does not like having people break their word to him and clearly has influence in important places.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the PCs may prefer to try to work out what the mission is and undertake it freelance. With so little to go on this is unlikely and doomed to failure.</p>\n<p>After they get more detail from Jamys they may try to find Kutz without Jamys’ help in the hope that they can gain more than Jamys is offering. Apart from the practicalities of making their way up-river without Kuboran escort the GM should remind them that they have no guarantee the Constable of Caer Tormau would deal with them. If any of the PCs are themselves Kuboran then that would give them a greater chance of success, but surviving the encounters on the river and reaching their goal without the tacit support of the Asawne Kubora will be a challenge.</p>\n<h3><strong>An Offer They Can't Refuse</strong></h3>\n<p>The mission as described by Jamys is extremely simple. All that is required is that the PCs travel up the River Denia in search of a lost employee of the constable of Caer Tormau, a mercenary captain called Coln of Kutz.</p>\n<p>They will travel 5 leagues from Tormau to Quyn manor on the north bank of the River Denia on ponies Jamys will provide. There they will be met by Kuboran guides who will take them by boat a further 10 leagues upstream to a Kuboran village where the Earl maintains a trading post.</p>\n<p>Jamys will give them a note for Ardo of Guil, the Earl’s man there, which should ensure his cooperation. It simply states ‘<em>These are to be treated well as friends of our mutual acquaintance</em>’ and signed ‘<em>Jamys</em>’.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.GrOc6hL85SxyBSgt]{Jamys' Note}</p>\n<p>Where they go after that depends on what they can find out about Kutz and where he might be.</p>\n<p>They are to find Kutz and bring him back. If he is already dead and the body cannot be recovered then they must bring proof, preferably in the form of a convincing witness, of the circumstances of his death. If for any reason Kutz is unwilling, or unable, to return then he is not to be allowed to remain alive and they must return his head to Jamys as proof that they have completed their mission.</p>\n<p>With this last point Jamys takes time to look each PC in the eye as if to assure himself that they have the will and grit for such a final act.</p>\n<p>Jamys will tell them that the ponies will be ready by mid-morning tomorrow and he will send word now to ensure the guides are ready to depart from Quyn at midday. The ponies will be well provisioned for the short journey to Quyn and the guides will have everything they need for the river journey. He gives the PCs 20% of their final fee in earnest of goodwill and wishes them good night and good luck.</p>\n<p>Jamys is a reasonably honest criminal as criminals go and values the licence the Earl grants him to do business in Tormau and the surrounding Hundreds. He is therefore conveying exactly what he has been told to convey to the PCs by the Earl’s brother Vavryse Lynnaeus, constable of Caer Tormau. In his dealings with the PCs Jamys is acting in good faith and questions about the mission can be answered using the following information.</p>\n<p><strong>If no PC speaks any Kuboran (Old Jarinese) …</strong></p>\n<p>Jamys can provide a Rethemi who does. Wyrden of Lomec has worked as a scout among the various logging camps that the Kubora allow the Earl to sustain along the Denia and its tributaries. He is a rough sort who will do anything for a decently filled purse. Wyrden is not particularly bright so is unlikely to provide the PCs with many original thoughts during the adventure. He will act as a translator and help the PCs make their way among the Kubora. He has a better understanding of the tribesmen than most as they often come to the logging camps to trade.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.actors.ukIy9KJ1fSD8S2bR]{Wyrden of Lomec}</p>\n<p><strong>If Jamys is asked about Coln of Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>Jamys can tell them Kutz came to Tormau three summers ago with a small band of mercenaries. The Earl is always on the look-out for men hardened to battle and Kutz certainly looked the part. He is a head taller than the tallest PC and heavy built. Strong of arm and hale of health he was entirely bald and was thought eccentric for keeping a full red beard. He also had a long, angry, scar on his left forearm that rumour said he’d gained as a thief when a child in Tashal, the great city of the East. He claimed to have some learning and kept a scrawny scribe with him as an affectation.</p>\n<p>He gained favour with the Earl and was often sent off on missions into the forest when he and his band would be away for days at a time. Then, one day last summer, he and his men weren’t around anymore. Whether he’d been sent away, or run away, got lost or decided to get lost, Jamys doesn’t know.</p>\n<p>Jamys believes Kutz was expected back at Tormau before winter set in but there’s been no word of him through the Spring.</p>\n<p>Whatever happened, he’s now wanted back.</p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>As the meeting takes place the night before their planned departure there will be little opportunity to make any enquiries until the morning.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.QB0RXECZqHV47vS4]{Act I - Scene 2: Making Inquiries}</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.BrKOI6jfoL8NsuBJ","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_hatx2zk5zmb","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act I:  Into the Forest","color":"#2db43d","sort":100000}}}

He has thought long and hard about whether he should say anything to them about his fears but his obligations as their host means he cannot stay his tongue lest they come to harm through his failure to act.

The other Kubora show him as much deference as any one Kuboran shows to another. He is accompanied by two warriors, one of whom is either Acurdin (if the PCs helped him earleir) or Garach (if Acurdin lost his honour).  The other is a comely woman of 20 or so armed as any man. She is Sytari ‘The Man’, who has chosen meinirhyfel: ‘the path of the man’. This allows her to act and be treated as a man in all things. PCs that condescend to her as if to a woman will risk abuse from her or the other Kubora, before Gomas calms things down. They walk slightly behind the Hanuhn.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.Y0BKdJ1Ft0GFfeDW]{Hanuhn Gomas 'Straight Arrow'}</p>\n<p>He has good Harnic and invites the visitors bearing the colours of his friend and ally the Earl of Tormau to share a meal with him. He leads them to his hut which is guarded by two other hunters.</p>\n<p>Acurdin and Sytari join them in a meal of tasty broth and flat bread. After the meal Gomas is straightforward in declaring his interest in the characters, telling them that he has had a vision of their coming ‘in the trees and in the river; in the air and in the night’. He tells them that he knows something of their mission. He may not tell them what they should do but will answer their questions if he can.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Kutz...</strong></p>\n<p>Gomas tells them he believes they are being sent after a man who is already as good as dead. Kutz was sent to make peace and keep the Kubora under control. Instead the Hanuhn believes he has roused something that was best left undisturbed. He believes the characters have been sent after Kutz to put an end to the chaos he is unknowingly going to unleash. He believes that they are sent to kill Kutz.</p>\n<p>Coln Kutz thought himself protected from the forest but he went too far into its heart and there he appears to have discovered that the old ways of the Kubora are not to be discounted.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Crador...</strong></p>\n<p>The Asawne shaman has recently learned that the Denal Kubora are sending messages across Peran. He even believes they may have sent word to the ‘Left Behind’, the Urdu. They are saying that ‘Crador will rest’.</p>\n<p>There is an ancient prophesy that says ‘The Trickster’ will one day fall asleep. If Crador were to rest then he would no longer send nightmares and evil luck; but equally he would no longer send good fortune.</p>\n<p>Were the prophesy to come to pass then the tribes believe the life of the Kubora would change forever; some say the world would end. Before that happens every Kuboran will seek to gain Kemlar’s favour so they are worthy to meet him in the after-life. They will gain that favour by taking every opportunity to fulfil the tasks he set them: <em>Battle the land, and thy brethren, and those of thy kindred that stayed behind, for in clean strife shall the heart be joyous, and the hand grow harder.</em> That may mean war and disaster.</p>\n<p>This is why more southrons have been attacked this last season and why the Suyari came after Acurdin in response to a trivial slight at the Moot. All are looking for chances to build their honour in case they meet Kemlar sooner than they had expected.</p>\n<p>All the tribes have revered Crador for the good luck he brings and fear him for the bad luck his nightmares presage.  Worship takes different forms among the tribes: some love him; some hate him; some laugh at him, but few dare ignore him. They all remember the prophesy.</p>\n<p>Were those among the tribes who believe in the prophesy to sway others then the tribes might unite and sweep south again, as they did in the time of Arlun. Every Kuboran who joined such a fight would have the opprtunity to build-up his name so that Kemlar would notice him at the World’s End. This is why Gomas has sent word to the Earl warning that tribal alliances are more fragile than in several generations.</p>\n<p>The Denal started sending their messages shortly after the Earl’s man, Kutz, passed further up river. Some are saying he is part of some Denal dream linked to Crador’s rest.</p>\n<p>Gomas is not one of the tribal leaders who believes in these ancient prophesies. He has always taught that a man can shape his own fortune and should not blame Crador for any ill luck that befalls him. However he is disturbed by the rumors as other leaders will be reacting differently to him.  He does not want his people to sacrifice themselves on a blade fashioned from an ancient prophesy.</p>\n<p><strong>If asked where Kutz went...</strong></p>\n<p>Up river from the village is a boundary, a boundary that no Asawne Kubora crosses unless in dire need. When illness strikes a clan or the hunting is poor then someone takes on the ‘necklace of bone’ and is sent to the headwaters of the Denia as a ‘gift of sacrifice’. In return the ‘Trickster’ will bring better dreams and make those dreams come true. None have been selected as a ‘gift’ since Gomas became the tribe’s Hanuhn, something he is very proud of.</p>\n<p>Kutz crossed that boundary – whether he did it willingly or not he will have reaped his reward...</p>\n<p><strong>If asked about the Denal Kubora...</strong></p>\n<p>The Denal Kubora were once great warrior heroes but have served Crador since Kemlar left his People. They guard ‘The Hand of Crador’ jealously. When the southrons tried to take the forest from the Kubora long ago they came to find the ‘Hand’ saying that it belonged to their god. That and other sacrileges brought the tribes together and the Kubora smote the invaders like the falling tree strikes the ground when the storms blow their worst.</p>\n<p>Gomas never told Kutz that he had dreamed about him and of the ‘Hand’. What would bring the two together he doesn’t know but he does know the fates of the Hand and of the man are bound together.</p>\n<p>The Denal say that Kutz is the saviour they have been waiting for and that ‘Crador will rest’. With that rest will come an end to the Denal’s servitude to the god but it also brings the risk of the end of the world.</p>\n<p>Gomas feels guilty that he did not share what he forseen with Kutz – he feared to alter the will of the gods. Now he fears the characters also have a part to play – be it for good or ill he does not know. This is why he is talking to them.  He will not be made guilty a second time. If Crador is truly to rest and the world is to come to an end he wishes to have this act weighed in the balance in his favour.</p>\n<p>Gomas now feels his conscience is clear. He wishes them well and hopes their fate is to stop whatever chain of events Kutz has set in motion, before it is too late.</p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs ask for help traveling upstream...</strong></p>\n<p>He will think carefully and tell them he will provide guides for them. If they aided Acurdin against the Suyari then Acurdin will lead the guides as before. If the PCs did not aid Acurdin then Garach leads the guides and any subsequent reference to Acurdin should be read as Garach.</p>\n<p>Gomas makes it clear that he can ask his people to escort the PCs to the top of the Denia cataract but not beyond.  That is a decision they must make for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>When Gomas has said all he has to say...</strong></p>\n<p>He bids the characters farewell and dismisses them. As they leave his hut they notice he is flipping a small round token, which might have a sun carved on one side and a waning moon on the other.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>That night...</strong></h3>\n<p>If they did not aid Acurdin earlier, then they will have no alternative but to spend the night in Ardo’s hut. It’s more roomy but he snores.</p>\n<p>If they aided Acurdin in his confrontation with the Suyari they will be invited to sleep in his batchelor hut, or the hut of one of the other guides if there are more than three PCs. If they saved, or attempted to save the child from the snake then the grandmother will bring them food that night whether they sleep in Acurdin, or Ardo’s, hut.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Link To The Next Scene</strong></h3>\n<p>Next morning Acurdin and the guides will ready the boats for an early departure and will be ready to leave when the PCs make their way to the dock.</p>\n<p>Clearly news of their mission has circulated among the Asawne as the majority of the village has turned out to watch them leave. The Asawne line the path to the boats in silence. Many of them bow to the PCs or sadly shake their heads as they pass; fingering the small wooden tokens that have become so familiar to the PCs. The PCs get a clear sense that the villagers do not expect to see them return and are showing respect for their bravery in going any further.</p>\n<p>If they saved, or tried to save the child, then a grandmother steps from the crowd just before they arrive at the dock and presses something into the hand of the PC who intervened with the child: tokens for each PC on leather thongs; newly carved the previous night.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.HbcpnntfwspnCbIR]{Token}</p>\n<p>She says something in the Kuboran dialect that a speaker of Old Jarinese, or a guide, will translate as <em>‘You will need these when you challenge the Trickster for the fate of the world’.</em></p>\n<p>@Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.Cl7WPDczBeTrIxq3]{Act III: Further Upstream}</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.olTZ66uGtSYUa1bD","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6sup32vavy3","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/Act II:  The Asawne","color":"#30832a","sort":175000}}}

{"_id":"k8mGc5HbvPZqmzKT","name":"Lia-Kavair Business","content":"<p>Jamys is the most senior Lia-Kavair guild master in Hohnamshire. He receives tribute from masters at Zaza and Ithius and directly controls guild activities in Winen, Dasen and Quiso. Jamys doesn’t begrudge this independence of Ithiko as the town is known to offer poor pickings. Relations with the other Rethemi masters is cordial and Jamys sends tribute to the guild in Golotha as do the masters at Ithiko, Techen and Shostim.</p>\n<p>The Warriors of Mameka have a very high minded view of the law and apply it rigorously. When they arrived at Alesen a generation ago they quickly identified anyone across Emesa Hundred they thought might have Lia-Kavair connections and publicly executed them. A salted head was then sent for display in every town across the shire. The gruesome gift arrived with a note addressed to ‘the local representative of the Lia-Kavair – know your fate if you come to Emesa Hundred’.</p>\n<p>This dramatic demonstration has kept Jamys and, as far as he is aware, any other Lia-Kavair master, well away from the fiefs of the Warriors until recently. However, last Summer, Vavryse Lynnaeus, Constable of Caer Tormau suggested that Jamys send some associates north. Fortunately a year or two before Jamys had had to send some employees north when they killed a visitor from clan Zarainsen of Golotha. He never expected to see them again having told the Zarainsen’s he’d had them killed. Now he has re-established communication with the Wonnist brothers and suggested they let him know the lie of the land. In this way Earl Denyl has begun to receive increasingly well-informed news of the Warriors of Mameka and just how badly they suffered during their ill-fated expedition to Kustan in 718. Jamys is not entirely convinced that the Earl would be able to protect him if the Warriors discovered his agents.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time that Vavryse Lynnaeus has used Jamys as an effective cut-out when undertaking less than legal work on behalf of his brother the Earl. In return Jamys enjoys a deal of latitude in his actions. He regulates crime in the Earl’s holdings better then the castle garrison could, ensures his taxes are always on time; and includes a ‘gift towards the defence of the town’ each season. Of course no member of the Earl’s household is ever allowed to pay for anything at the Stoat.</p>\n<p>As criminals go Jamys is an honest crook and abides by the mutually beneficial arrangement he has established with the castle. He understands that if he were to take undue advantage of the Earl’s favour then he could be swatted out of existence like an unwelcome bluebottle at a feast. This is why the demands he makes of local tradesmen for protection are seen by all parties as ‘fair’. Equally his squeezing of the beggar population is not so harsh as to discourage them from talking to him when he needs to hear what they know.</p>\n<p>Jamys knows that being master of the Lia-Kavair in Tormau is as good a life as he could have dreamed of when he was growing up in the slums of Golotha. He would do almost anything to make sure his peace and prosperity remains undisturbed. His only current worry is that the impending civil war will disrupt his rural idyll. If things get difficult he has a fortune buried in the brew house and sufficient portable wealth closer at hand for emergencies. With that he would make a dash for the anonymity of Golotha and seek to live out his life in comfortable retirement.</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/scenes/Heart_of_Darkness/White_Stoat_Inn_GM_Map.PNG","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.v2ks1hSlLT2yKS7J","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_b8slu2n3iw","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/The White Stoat Inn","color":"#212121","sort":800000}}}

They will eject any commoner who is not equally civil.</p>\n<p>Setarn values the respect he is offered at the Stoat and does not embarrass Jamys if a customer of noble birth makes a fuss about his presence; he merely finishes his drink and leaves quietly.</p>\n<p>Rumours say that the Jamys and Setarn share business interests. The Kuboran’s income is sufficient for him to keep a house and servants in the style of a Rethemi gentleman.</p>\n<h2>Lia Kavair Journeymen</h2>\n<p>The 4 usually present at the inn are no more than efficient muscle to protect Jamys’ local interests. Across Hohanmshire, though, are all manner of guildsmen from pick-pockets and burglars to horse thieves and cheating gamblers. Markets in all the towns owing Jamys fealty are alive with apprentices taking a coin here, a basket of fruit there, and the product of any guildsman not sharp eyed enough to spot them coming. They all owe Jamys allegiance and at different times they all pass through the bunks in the White Stoat’s attic when they are too ‘hot’ to stay in their homes.</p>\n<p>Hugin, Merla and the other staff know exactly what goes on at the inn and know many of the guildsmen as friends. Equally many a journeyman has benefited from Merla’s food and Hugin’s hospitality. That’s not to say these disreputable characters would go too far out on a limb for the staff of the Stoat but enlightened self interest means they would usually intervene if help was needed.</p>","img":"modules/heart-of-darkness/image_library/scenes/Heart_of_Darkness/White_Stoat_Inn_GM_Map.PNG","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"x7bG2mHcyINoyNtL":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.om4Eozlu4Ru0vJq3","hash":"48bfdaa31d679b437f2f05b653ec46d552d71988"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.hm-adv-sos.journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE"},"undefined":{"hash":"16f413505994ea0d58ec944bd54d63f292d834cc"},"cf":{"id":"temp_b8slu2n3iw","path":"Heart of Darkness#/CF_SEP/The White Stoat Inn","color":"#212121","sort":700000}}}

Its attention is not something to encourage as once its attention is drawn to the PCs it will begin to exert its influence on them, pulsing more rapidly as it does so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is capable of <em><strong>Mental Conflicts</strong></em> (EML 90% - 5% per additional target) against anyone within the Chamber (but not outside it in the passage) every combat round. If any character loses the Mental Conflict then instead of their spirit being ‘evicted’ from their body the victim stops what they are doing and moves towards the Heart with their hands stretched out towards it. It is a tribute to Kutz that he remained strong enough to continue his attacks on the Heart with one hand while the other was consumed. Now his actions are purely mechanical and lacking in higher, rational, functions; those were first things the Heart consumed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If a PC’s flesh contacts the column...</strong></p>\n<p>It takes a single combat round for a character to stumble into contact with the column of limestone and the Heart within. If they have no other exposed flesh then they will lay their cheek against it. If they have no exposed skin then they will begin to tear at their clothes or discard their full helm to expose their flesh. This buys another combat round before contact is made.</p>\n<p>As soon as their flesh makes contact with the column then the Heart will attempt a second Mental Combat which the PC must resist or embrace the column and begin being consumed by it. Embracing the Heart means there comes a vision of what they are embracing that offers them a last shocked opportunity to force themselves away from it.</p>\n<p><strong>If the victim asks about what they have seen...</strong></p>\n<p>They are so shocked by the ‘vision’ that they cannot bear to think of it again. Instead...Roll d%:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&lt;= 1xWIL the shock has been such that they have managed to brace themselves so that only one hand is in contact with the Heart (like Kutz);</li>\n<li>&lt;= 2 x WIL they can use both arms to brace themselves dropping anything in their hands to do so;</li>\n<li>Any other roll and they ignore their ‘vision’ and embrace the Heart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If the bracing hand(s) is/are gloved...</strong></p>\n<p>The character can continue to hold themselves away from the Heart (and delay its effects) until their strength gives out. Each combat round costs 1 Fatigue and the GM should use the ‘Lifting’ rules to determine if they can keep their own weight away from the Heart. It is almost as if gravity is drawing them towards it.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects of contact with the column...</strong></p>\n<p>Once flesh contacts the limestone and the Heart within the character begins to lose a characteristic point from INT, AUR, WIL and MORALITY, in sequence, every minute they remain in contact (e.g. after 1 minute they lose 1 INT; after the 2nd minute they lose 1 AUR, etc.). These points are lost permanently.</p>\n<p>If they have successfully braced themselves with two hands this loss is every 2 minutes; if they have braced them selves so that only one hand is in contact then the loss is every 4 minutes.</p>\n<p>Once a character’s INT reaches zero they will remain braced against the column (frozen, like Kutz).</p>\n<p>Once a character’s AUR reaches zero then their body will begin to mineralise. Mineralization spreads from points of skin contact and takes a number of weeks equal to weight in pounds/10.</p>\n<p><em>Hopefully</em> other PCs will see what is happening long before this and intervene to save their comrade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If other PCs try to restrain the victim...</strong></p>\n<p>The stumbling character can be wrestled to the ground by other PCs with <em><strong>Grappling</strong></em> against Ignore to stop them reaching the Heart, but as more PCs succumb to the Heart's <em><strong>Mental Conflict</strong></em> attacks there will be fewer and fewer left to save their friends! The PCs should quickly realise that they are in a game with sharply diminishing returns.</p>\n<p>The GM should not allow the PCs time to discuss their options at this point but should demand that they act in real time, rolling repeatedly for <em><strong>Mental Combat</strong></em>. This should ramp up the pace and the panic but also help them realise that they cannot stay here and survive for long.

No doubt he’d still happily cut their throats if he encountered them in the forest but he’s got used to pay and the Earl’s supplies and does not intend to have to run for the forest by behaving stupidly. His primary language is the Old Jarinese dialect spoken by the Kubora but he’s picked up a lot of Harnic during his time in the Earl’s service.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If asked about Coln Kutz …</strong></p>\n<p>Kutz went out of his way to get to know the Kuboran mercenaries and to learn their language – not like most of the southrons or northmen.

They sometimes acted as go betweens or emissaries to the tribes. Coed means ‘trees’ and rheg means ‘run’ in their dialect. They are respectful of Kuboran ways and go out of their way to show they understand they are the inferiors when in the forest. Kutz knew he was an outsider and behaved honourably.

Equally it has no recollection of who, or what, bound it here, but knows that it was for an important reason – to help keep something contained or protected.</p>\n<p>The spirit’s capacity to influence the environment around its eerie declines very quickly with increased distance from its ‘binding rune’. Within the small cavern it is at almost the full physical strength of its prime. This is why its cave remains clean and undisturbed. It has kept out any bird that has sought to nest in the cave and a wall of pressure that keeps the Harpies out.</p>\n<p>While its physical strength declines quickly away from the cave its senses have awoken to almost full strength and its perceptions stretch out from the cave as far as the boundary of the Hand and down into the air spaces between the limestone pillars. If the PCs scale one of the pillars seeking entry to the Hand it will sense their presence as the only genuinely intelligent creatures it remembers ever encountering. In an effort to attract their attention it will seek to buffet a passing Yelgri in a way that any PC with <em><strong>Weatherlore</strong></em> will instantly see as curiously unnatural.

{"_id":"y8TCpD3q2dLrMqIn","name":"13 (Lower Level) Confronting Kutz","content":"<p><strong>The PCs have several possible courses of action...</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walk away – the hope has to be that the PCs tribulations to date will make this inconceivable. As an incentive, if the PCs do leave without Kutz they should find the Spirit of Earth outside the chamber waiting for them. It will drive them back into the passage to the Chamber but will not advance.</li>\n<li>Kill Kutz where he stands – this would fit within their terms of reference but has consequences (see below) and they still have to get at least his head out as proof.  There is at least a hope that if they could free him from the Heart he could walk out under his own power.  @Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.nkRbZ1NpL9ocqeaS]{13 (Lower Level) Confronting The Heart}</li>\n<li>Wrestle him free from the column – grappling the body of Kutz while he seeks to destroy the Heart with his broken sword is not difficult but no matter what strength the PCs bring to bare (and 3 of them can gain a hold on him at any one time) they will make no progress.  His hand is not simply resting on the block but been merged with it, his flesh being consumed alongside his spirit by the Heart.</li>\n<li>Cut him free of the Block by severing his forearm - this is allowed within their terms of reference. The target is inert and his forearm does not yet have the resilience to damage of the limestone or the Heart within so it will not be difficult to achieve this with an edged weapon. A PC should be allowed to strike the arm below the point at which it has begun to atrophy to stone unless they CF. If they aim higher and take his arm off above the elbow then he will need rapid medical attention if he is not to bleed to death.  @Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.nkRbZ1NpL9ocqeaS]{13 (Lower Level) Confronting The Heart}</li>\n<li>Attack the Heart themselves – they can attempt this but looking at the progress Kutz has made they might judge this an unlikely route to success. They would be right in this judgement. The other half of his sword blade lies at his feet (Weaponcraft will show it to be of good quality).  While he has successfully hacked a deep notch in the limestone it is making no impression on the beating Heart within. The Heart should be considered immune to physical attack, even if its coat of limestone and atrophied bodies could be prized away from it. However any attack on it will raise its awareness of the PCs.  @Compendium[heart-of-darkness.journals.nkRbZ1NpL9ocqeaS]{13 (Lower Level) Confronting The Heart}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be better for subsequent adventures in this series if Kutz can be brought from the Hand alive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>If the PCs either:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>attack the limestone column;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>add their attacks to the notch Kutz has already cut;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>kill Kutz;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>severe his left arm to free him; or</strong></li>\n<li><strong>deliberately touch the stalagmite or seek to make mental contact of any kind with what beats within...</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Heart will become aware of them.
